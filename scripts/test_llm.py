Bramwell had become the second general of the Salvation Army after the death of his father, General William Booth, in 1912. While in New York, Bramwell Booth also visited his sister Eva, head of the United States' branch of the Army, and his brother, General Ballington Booth, the head of the Volunteers of America, an organization that had broken away from the Salvation Army, 17 years earlier. Bramwell Booth (1856-1929) was the second General of the Salvation Army, succeeding his father, William Booth, founder of the organization. Bramwell's sister, Evangeline (Eva) Booth (1865-1950), became the Army's fourth General (1934-39). A naturalized U. S. citizen, Eva was the Army's Commander of the United States from 1904 to 1934. These photos, dated November 26, 1913 (the day before Thanksgiving), show the parade of Salvation Army faithful who accompanied Bramwell to the docks that morning to see him off for England aboard the &quot;France,&quot; a ship of the French Line.

Ah, but he has just left the field after a practice session, and doubtless wants a photo to send back home to New Jersey, to impress his high school sweetheart.

Ms. Rosenthal played in many championships in the late 1910s through the mid-1930s, representing the Chicago area and playing out of Ravisloe Country Club in Homewood, Illinois. She volunteered her services as part of &quot;The Dixie Kids&quot; a foursome of talented teenage golfers who barnstormed the United States in 1917–18 playing exhibition matches. Those charity matches marked the first time in the history of golf that spectators paid for tickets to watch a golf event. In this case, the money raised went to the American Red Cross to buy medical supplies for use on the battlefields of Europe.

Harry Vardon also made famous the &quot;Vardon grip&quot; a way of holding the golf club where (for a right handed golfer) the small finger of the right hand overlaps the index finger of the left hand on the club.

A search in <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov" rel="nofollow">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov</a> will uncover mentions of Drobach winning, placing high, or participating in many races from 1908 through 1922 - a fairly long career. Road racing was not common - over this period the kind of bicycle racing that was popular varied somewhat over time and Drobach seems to have been able to do well in many types, including motor-paced cycle racing (drafting at high speed behind a motorcycle), relatively short distance races in velodromes, and six-day bicycle races in venues such as Madison Square Garden. This head-on photo doesn't allow much appreciation of the bicycle he was on, but it would have been a single speed track back, which is probably all he ever rode in competition. A bicycle such as that, with no gears or brakes, could be built at a low weight (no heavier than a present day road bike made of carbon fiber) but sufficiently strong. The rider could have the gearing changed to suit the type of race. Occasionally one can find a photograph like this in a newspaper in Chronicling America but I don't see this one.

In a 1914 match, Hoppe overcame a 210 point defecit to defeate Yamada. A Nov 3 1912 NY Times Article (&quot;Jap Billiardist to Play for Title&quot;) has a short bio. Yamada had been living for two years in Berlin. At the time he was the shortest contender for the billiards title. He was ambidextrous and seldom used a bridge. He is described as &quot;matter of fact&quot;, &quot;prompt&quot;, and efficient.

Bramwell had become the second general of the Salvation Army after the death of his father, General William Booth, in 1912. While in New York, Bramwell Booth also visited his sister Eva, head of the United States' branch of the Army, and his brother, General Ballington Booth, the head of the Volunteers of America, an organization which had broken away from the Salvation Army, 17 years earlier. Bramwell Booth (1856-1929) was the second General of the Salvation Army, succeeding his father, William Booth, founder of the organization. Bramwell's sister, Evangeline (Eva) Booth (1865-1950), became the Army's fourth General (1934-39). A naturalized U. S. citizen, Eva was the Army's Commander of the United States from 1904 to 1934.

Charles E. Courtney (November 13, 1849 – July 17, 1920) was an American rower and rowing coach from Union Springs, New York. A carpenter by trade, Courtney was a nationally known amateur rower. Courtney never lost as an amateur and finished a total of 88 victories. In 1877 he moved from an amateur to a professional rower, a decision that Courtney would later regret. His professional career was marred by controversy and accusations including cowardice and race fixing. His professional career was best remembered for his controversial losses to Ned Hanlan. Some[who?] believe that the controversies surrounding the Hanlan and Courtney races caused a public backlash against professional rowing that eventually led to its death in the United States. As his rowing career wound down, Courtney became involved in coaching at Cornell University. He coached Cornell’s rowing team from 1883 to 1920. His crews won 14 of 24 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta, varsity eight oared titles. He kept his position until he died in the summer of 1920.

This is Swedish runner Anatole Bolin (Jakob Pehr Anatole Dedekind Bolin) (1893-1983). He held the world record in the 1000 yard event 1918-1922. He competed in the 400m and the 800m events of the 1920 Olympics but did not medal. The photo was likely taken in Stockholm Stadium in 1917 when Bolin set a Swedish record in the 1000m and 400m events, August 19-20, 1917.

The US AAU invited Bolin and fellow countryman John Zander to compete in the US in the spring of 1917, but due to the hazards of wartime ocean travel, the Swedish athletic governing authority declined.

Daniels' visit to the Recruit in Union Square was on March 16, 1918: &quot;Daniels Makes Voyage on Good Ship Recruit Secretary Tells Crowd Navy Has Just Begun to Do Things As Josephus Daniels. Secretary of the Navy, climbed aboard the good ship Recruit, anchored in the sea of people that filled Union Square yesterday afternoon, the Secretary's flag, furled for breaking, was loosened to the breeze and the naval band struck up &quot;Hail to the Chief.&quot; Advancing bravely toward a battery of motion picture cameras. Mr. Daniels shook hands with Commander Charles A. Adams, in charge of the sturdy vessel. Then followed an informal inspection of the ship no submarine will ever sink. &quot;Why, this is a real ship,&quot; remarked the Secretary to her commander. &quot;I can almost hear the waves beating outside.&quot; While officers and enlisted men stood at attention, he examined the quarters below, including the aft cabin, resplendent in the gay red furnishings taken from the Vaterland, erstwhile pride of the Kaiser's fleet. Then, followed by his aid, Lieutenant Frost, and Henry McDonnel, director general of the Mayor's committee on National Defence, he climbed to the deck and made a brief address to the crowd. &quot;As this ship stands in the heart of the metropolis,&quot; he said. &quot;so our navy is safely anchored in the hearts of the American people. Our boys in blue over there have already captured German submarines, and they have sunk more of them than I can tell.&quot; After the cheers which interrupted this comment, he added: &quot;But what they have done is only an inkling of what they will do to bring this war to a successful conclusion.&quot; Escorted to the motor car which awaited him near by, the Secretary stood at attention while the band on board played &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Before the crowd could surge away another speaker was leaning over the rail, and the good ship Recruit was hitting the stride for which it has become famous. After W. T. Whitmore had finished a brief appeal for volunteers, eleven young men stepped out of the crowd to go to work for Josephus Daniels and Uncle Sam's navy.&quot; New York Tribune, March 17, 1918 <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1918-03-17/ed-1/seq-6/" rel="nofollow">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1918-03-17/ed-...</a> This photo, with all hands over hearts and Daniels standing on the running board of his car, is likely the part where the national anthem was played.

LWyman, Thanks for the heads up. You are right, this is indeed the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills, Long Island. The event taking place is the Davis Cup Match between the American and the Australasian teams. This photograph shows the doubles match between Anthony F. Wilding and Norman E.

After attending the Hotchkiss School, he enrolled at Yale University. He played every game for Yale's varsity football team in 1911, 1912, and 1913. He helped lead Yale to a 7-2-1 record in 1911 and a 7-1-1 record om 1912 and was a consensus All-American in both of those years.

En route to his home in Weston, he was stricken in Newtonville station Monday afternoon by a heart attack. Fisher is one of the great names of Harvard football history. After he entered Harvard from Andover in 1908, he rose to the top as a player in intercollegiate football where for three years he was Varsity right guard. He was named to Walter Camp's All America in 1910 and 1911, and captained the Crimson in 1911. He later succeeded his teacher the late Percy Haughton, as head coach in 1919.

At Pasadena on January 1, 1920, his team completed an unbeaten season by conquering Oregon, 7 to 6. In that game Captain Arnold Horween played one of the hero's roles and later succeeded &quot;Bob&quot; Fisher as head coach. Fisher was born on December 3, 1888 in Boston, son of Rollin B. Fisher. In September, 1917, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Army Air Force and rose to captain by the end of the war. He was married to Louise A.

He died when his plane crashed in France during a training flight. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nG4vAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA557&amp;lpg=PA557&amp;dq=pfaffman+tennis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u3Rxsk49-p&amp;sig=GsjCFZgaW403lU2dGZ6GJ8vW8AY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MUyKU4PVMcTjoASP6oGYBw&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pfaffman tennis&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">books.google.com/books?id=nG4vAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA557&amp;l...</a> <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70F16F7355B17738DDDA10A94D0405B868DF1D3" rel="nofollow">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70F16F7355B17...</a> See also: &quot;Jack Pfaffman Killed While Flying&quot;, American Lawn Tennis, September 1, 1918. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ImQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=john+s.+pfaffman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cS-pHQgZhw&amp;sig=_xZ7OmfD5pIQG0-2VM9F1ZTTtUk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2CKU_CEG8iAogS5moGgBw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=john s. pfaffman&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">books.google.com/books?id=ImQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA221&amp;l...</a>

I knew this would be a tough one. I wondered if was some type of publicity stunt, but I can't figure out what for. When I first saw this photo I searched around for some of the competitive swimmers of the time, and thought it looked a little like Gertrude Ederle but I wasn't certain.
this photo is listed as &quot;June 22, 1911.

Parade at the decennial Great International Congress of the Salvation Army, London, June 1914. The Salvation Army's Great International Congress was held in London, England, beginning June 11, 1914. The congress was held every 10 years, and this was an auspicious opportunity to share experiences and enthusiasms with thousands of people from 58 countries including England, Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada. The largest delegation, outside of England, was from the United States, which sent 600 men and women and 100 children. The American delegation included four bands, from New York; Chicago; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Flint, Michigan. The 55 band members from Flint were auto workers, and their expenses were paid by local businessmen. Elsewhere, American delegates paid their own expenses.

Clark's application was heard by Judge Martin in the common pleas court in the New Jersey city, and the judge at first denied the application when there was a slipup on the part of the cyclist in regards to the latter having lived in Salt Lake City during the season of 1911.

pennylrichardsca: Thanks for the comment! It appears, from a quick search through the New York Times, that Ms. Stratton was in multiple tournaments in 1914 and in the years surrounding, so it would be difficult to say this is the women's national championship without a bit more confirming information. However, we can certainly expand the descriptive information to reflect her status a golfer, which is an improvement over the basic information given. Thanks!

The sports news in 1925, the date of the photos in this batch of Bain photos, featured comparisons between Paavo Nurmi, who was in the U.S. in 1925 with his countryman who had come 12 years earlier. According to the Evening Star.

Kolehmainen, when he came here 12 years ago, was heralded as the superathlete, and it was believed that the marks he created would stand forever. Yet, a few years later, there was destined to come forth still a greater runner in the person of Paavo Nurmi, the draftsman of Abo. Until last night many of the figures had withstood every onslaught. Nurmi shattered two, to run his total of new world records made in this country to 10, and might have broken another had he kept his eyes on his stopwatch. See also the Evening Star.

The building at the left, behind the streetcar, says &quot;H.F. Rahe 1148&quot;. The Henry F. Rahe Cafe (per the 1917 city directory) was at 1148 St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan, which is between 167th and 168th Streets. So this shot is taken looking east along St. Nicholas, with the corner of 167th Street at right. The Navy probably set this up to take advantage of the huge crowds attending Billy Sunday's New York revival (held April through June, 1917), which was taking place just steps away, at his newly-built New York Tabernacle, at 168th and Broadway. In the Bain shot below of the crowds at Sunday's tabernacle, you can see 1148 St. Nicholas and the Uneeda Biscuit sign at the upper right. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/17176910922" title="Broadway after Sunday's meeting (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8713/17176910922_636ea13058.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="Broadway after Sunday's meeting (LOC)" /></a>
