A prototype of the (as noted) same type (PW-8) flown by Lt. Russell Maughan during his &quot;Dawn-to-Dusk&quot; transcontinental flight in June 1924. Given the January 1923 (&quot;1-19-23&quot;) date inscribed on the bottom of the print, this particular aircraft is almost certainly the first XPW-8 built. It would officially be acquired by the US Army Air Service in April of that year and assigned the serial number A.S. 23-1201, and the McCook Field project number P-295. It would later be modified with a second cockpit added and the aircraft given the designation of Corps Observation Experimental (CO-X).\n<i>See</i>:\n<a href=\"https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-pw-8-hawk/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-pw-8-hawk/</a>\n<blockquote>23 June 1924: Lieutenant Russell Lowell Maughan, Air Service, United States Army, took off from Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York, at 3:58 a.m., Eastern Time, and flew across the country to land at Crissy Field, at the Presidio of San Francisco, California at 9:46 p.m., Pacific Time. He covered a distance of 2,670 miles (4,297 kilometers) in 21 hours, 47 minutes. Maughan’s actual flight time was 20 hours, 48 minutes. He averaged 128.37 miles per hour (206.59 kilometers per hour).\n\nHis Dawn-To-Dusk transcontinental flight took place on a mid-summer day in order to take advantage of the longer hours of daylight, and he flew from East to West, to follow the advancing Sun across the sky.</blockquote>\nHere's a seeming contemporaneous photo (note the prop position, wheel and skid tracks, the aircraft has been manhandled and turned presumably to capture the best light for the photo) of the very same aircraft from the rear quarter.

McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader in the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. ...\nLater, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and protein expression that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; as of 2021, she remains the only woman who has received an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.&quot;","I wrote a play about McClintock, called, of course, MAIZE.

James Gilmore found a faded envelope containing newspaper clippings, pictures and memorabilia of his great aunt: Mabel G. Reinecke of Chicago. Although she died before Gilmore was born, it turns out Mabel was a pioneer-- and a groundbreaking woman of &quot;firsts.&quot; At the age of 18 she organized the Women's Progressive Republican League. After passage of the women's suffrage amendment, she visited every state west of the Mississippi to organize new voters. She was the first woman ever to receive a presidential commission and to occupy a federal executive position. In fact, she was the highest paid woman in federal service. But her life was also filled with challenge, disappointment and addiction, and after she died her legacy was largely forgotten. As Gilmore pieced together the amazing story of her life, he discovered articles, additional photographs and even a rare clip of newsreel film. This documentary short, created entirely of found-footage, is dedicated to Aunt Mabel and the forgotten stories of long-lost women everywhere.&quot;\n\nThe Perth Amboy Evening News.

On election night in 1922 there had been a pistol fight between Gregorio Lagana and Joseph Busardo at Tosca Gardens Cafe on Columbia Street. When police arrived they took Busardo who had been shot three times in the back to LI College Hospital as a prisoner. Lagana died. Busardo was later acquitted of the crime as there were no witnesses. On February 8, 1923 Jack Buccafusco and Charles Cucchairo had been visitng Vincent Busardo at his home on Homecrest Avenue. Two men in masks entered the home and killed Cucchairo. Police arrested Busardo &amp; Buccafusco because they did not believe their story. They were released. On April 6, 1923 Vincent Busardo was shot in the back while walking on\nDeGraw &amp; Columbia streets. While half conscious on his hospital bed he identified Umberto Anastasio &amp; Guiseppe Florino as his shooters when police brought them to his hospital room. Vincent Busardo died that evening. On April 29th 1923 two men were gunned down on Sackett Street. One man Biagi Giordano died and the other man U Anastasio was in critical condition. This shooting was said to be a vendetta for the killing of Busardo a few weeks earlier. Umberto who became Albert Anastasia and Joseph Florino were linked to many crimes including the disappearance of Pete Panta, a dock worker.&quot;\n\nSo I think this set of photos of Price (whoever he is) was taken in April 1923, consistent with the time-frame of many nearby photos in the Bain stream.","Given that Bain clearly had an arrangement with Victor, I looked for 1923 newspaper pages with &quot;victor records&quot; and &quot;price.&quot;\n\nThe Bismarck [N.D.] Tribune.

Giannini was plucked out of Sembrich's class and placed on the stage, an appearance which was a triumph. She received offers to perform with major orchestras and a recording contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company as a result.&quot;\n\nThe Victor contract was likely the trigger for Bain to commission a photo-shoot.","A photo a little earlier in the Bain stream with the same caption is <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/51029469127/in/photolist-2kVLdMJ-2kVTH2s-2kVTFWm-2kVVndm-2kVLdZT-2kVVmxP-2kVVmM1-2kVQRyc-2kKinke-2kKinwm-2kVLcsQ-2kVPFEV-2kVPG5T-2kVTFqw-2kVQR1U-2kVQQoX-2kVVm6g-8SLunT-9rk74J\" title=\"Giannini (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51029469127_a231bb9f77_n.jpg\" width=\"233\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Giannini (LOC)\" /></a>\nwhich is used in the Wikipedia entry for Dusolina.\n\nA photo in Evening star.

He had over 180 patents, but also a tumultuous career—he boasted that he made, then lost, four fortunes. He was also involved in several major patent lawsuits, spent a substantial part of his income on legal bills, and was even tried (and acquitted) for mail fraud. His most famous invention, in 1906, was the three-element &quot;Audion&quot; (triode) vacuum tube, the first practical amplification device. Although De Forest had only a limited understanding of how it worked, it was the foundation of the field of electronics, making possible radio broadcasting, long distance telephone lines, and talking motion pictures, among countless other applications.&quot;\n\nWe have seen his third wife earlier in the Bain stream: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8903300976/in/photolist-2kVQN2h-eyKKcf\" title=\"Mrs. Lee De Forest  (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/2866/8903300976_08a5e7c8ae_n.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Mrs. Lee De Forest  (LOC)\" /></a>","In April 1923, De Forest was collaborating with Hugo Riesenfeld in nearby Bain photo. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/51148542171/in/dateposted/\" title=\"H.

In an ironic twist, the first game was fittingly played against the Boston Red Sox, Babe’s former team. Even more fitting was that Babe Ruth hit the first homerun in the stadium on the opening day of the new ballpark – a three-run homerun, giving the Yankees the 4-1 win.\n\nAs a response to Babe’s opening day homerun, sportswriter Fred Lieb referred to Yankee Stadium in his column as “The House That Ruth Built”. It was a nickname that quickly stuck. Given Babe’s great ability to draw a crowd, this reference to Yankee Stadium became a regular term and is still used as the great ballpark’s less-formal name.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.baberuthcentral.com/babesimpact/babe-ruths-legacy/the-house-that-ruth-built/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.baberuthcentral.com/babesimpact/babe-ruths-legacy/the...</a>","The musicians pictured are &quot;Lieut.

It was created by the prominent sculptor Fritz Schaper on behalf of the city of Essen and was ceremoniously unveiled on July 14, 1889, the second anniversary of Alfred Krupp's death.&quot;\n\n&quot;Until the end of World War II, the memorial remained virtually undamaged in its place, although around 90 percent of the inner city was destroyed by bombs in the aerial warfare. But after the time of National Socialism, Krupp's reputation declined because the company was now viewed critically as the “armory of the German Reich” under Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler.\n\nAfter the surrender, the statue was initially used by American press photographers as a backdrop, but strangers soon pushed it into one of the bomb craters surrounding it. It is unclear who recovered the bronze figure and the stone base, brought it to the factory site and stored it there. It is known that the memorial was re-erected in a residential area in 1952, one year after Alfred's imprisoned great-grandson, Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, was released. The tensions between the city and the Krupp company gradually eased during the economic miracle, so that in the spring of 1961, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Krupp company, the memorial was again displayed at the Marktkirche. However, it was not exactly at the previous location in the axis of Kettwiger Strasse, but to the west of the church, slightly covered by a tree.&quot;\n\n&quot;After 61 years, in 2006, the Krupp memorial was moved to its original location.&quot;\n\nFor a postcard showing the location as it would have been in 1923, see <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Marktkirche_Essen_um_1912.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Marktkirche_Essen_um_1912...</a>\n\n360° view from 2016 showing location:  <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/amkfyRQkkWU49fmH6\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">goo.gl/maps/amkfyRQkkWU49fmH6</a>","<a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal_(Essen)\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal_(Essen)</a>\n\nUsing Google Translate\n&quot;After the foundation stone was laid on August 26, 1898 without a special celebration, the entire monument was inaugurated on October 23, 1898 in the middle of Burgplatz.&quot;\n\n&quot;In the course of a comprehensive redesign of the inner city, an urban planning concept was sought in a first architecture competition in 1924 to redesign the Burgplatz in a big city. As a result, the area of the square, which had previously sloped to the east, was straightened and connected to Burgstrasse with a wide staircase. In 1928 the equestrian statue was finally moved to its current location on the southwestern edge of Burgplatz, near the Lichtburg building, directly on Burgstrasse, with a new, simplified base without a terrace.&quot;\n\n2017 360° picture of statue in current location at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/1RstDLe81X7KGhrHA\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">goo.gl/maps/1RstDLe81X7KGhrHA</a>","The bank still exists.

Saunders worked for most of his life trying to develop a truly automated store, developing Piggly Wiggly, Keedoozle, and Foodelectric store concepts.&quot;\n\n&quot;in early 1923, a group of franchised outlets in New York failed. Merrill Lynch and other speculators on Wall Street attempted a bear raid on the price of Piggly Wiggly stock, gambling the price would fall. With a loan of $10 million from a number of Southern bankers, plus a bit of his own money, Saunders counteracted with a corner, buying a large amount of Piggly Wiggly stock in hopes of driving up the price. He flamboyantly declared his intent in newspaper ads. Saunders bought Piggly Wiggly stock until he had orders for 196,000 of the 200,000 outstanding shares. The firm's share price went from a low of $39 in late 1922 to $124 by March 20, 1923. Pressured by the 'bears', the New York Stock Exchange declared a 'corner' existed (see cornering the market), and gave the 'bears' five days rather than 24 hours to deliver the stock Saunders had bought.

But I haven't found any old photos that are from a similar viewpoint in the same time frame.","The recent improvement in image search has found this location for me (hey, artificial intelligence isn't all bad! 😄) According to a couple of sources this is Plaza de las Yerbas, now Parque Santander, in Bogota, Colombia: \n<a href=\"https://co.pinterest.com/pin/457959855832913776/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">co.pinterest.com/pin/457959855832913776/</a>\nand about a third of the way down this page:\n<a href=\"http://mikesbogotablog.blogspot.com/2011/12/bogota-city-of-churches.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">mikesbogotablog.blogspot.com/2011/12/bogota-city-of-churc...</a>\nThe tower on the left is the Iglesia de la Orden Tercera, still there on the northern corner of the square: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Vyyj8Vnvrj79hRTb9\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">goo.gl/maps/Vyyj8Vnvrj79hRTb9</a>\nYou can see the tower more clearly in this image which appears to have been taken at the same time as the LOC stereograph:\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/colombia_hist/status/612622206191820800/photo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">twitter.com/colombia_hist/status/612622206191820800/photo/1</a>\nThe building to the left with the belfry is the Church of Veracruz. It was destroyed in the earthquake of 1827 and rebuilt, with the present design dating from 1910.

He decided to walk over and watch the two play catch for awhile. Babe talked to the man for a little bit and found out that the little boy was only three years old. He was very impressed by how well the boy could play catch.\n\n&quot;Babe then got the idea to make the little boy, whose name was Ray Kelly, his personal mascot! So the next day, Babe picked up this little boy and took him to the stadium with him for his game. And, that’s how Little Ray Kelly became a part of the history of the game of baseball.\n\n&quot;Little Ray Kelly was Babe’s personal mascot for ten years. He even had his own Yankee uniform. And, he was with the Babe all the time during Yankee home games.&quot; [<a href=\"http://www.baberuthcentral.com/kids-clubhouse/babe-ray-kelly/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\"> 1 </a>]\n\n&quot;At age 13, Little Ray retired from the Yankees because his school obligations intervened. But Ruth had the boy and his father as his guests at the 1932 World Series, and they sat in a box seat next to the Yankees' dugout when Ruth hit his famed ''called shot'' home run in Game 3 at Wrigley Field off the Chicago Cubs' Charlie Root.\n\n&quot;Mr. Kelly maintained long afterward that Ruth did indeed point to the center-field bleachers before hitting the ball there.  'He absolutely did it,' he said. 'I was right there. Never in doubt.'\nAfter leaving the Yankees behind him in the early 1930's, he graduated from high school, then served as a sergeant in the Army Air Forces during World War II. Mr. Kelly later graduated from Pace University and worked as an accountant for Mobil Oil.&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/sports/ray-kelly-83-babe-ruth-s-little-pal-dies.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\"> 2 </a>]","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/43854658@N00/] Great story.

He was commander-in-chief of the Hellenic Army during the unsuccessful Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and led the Greek forces during the successful Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, in which Greece expanded to include Thessaloniki, doubling in area and population. He succeeded to the throne of Greece on 18 March 1913, following his father's assassination.\n\nHis disagreement with Eleftherios Venizelos over whether Greece should enter World War I led to the National Schism. Constantine forced Venizelos to resign twice, but in 1917 he left Greece, after threats by the Entente forces to bombard Athens; his second son, Alexander, became king. After Alexander's death, Venizelos' defeat in the 1920 legislative elections, and a plebiscite in favor of his return, Constantine was reinstated. He abdicated the throne for the second and last time in 1922, when Greece lost the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George II.

At the age of 82, in 1929, Clarke made the journey from the Black Hills to Washington, D.C., for the express purpose of extending a personal invitation to President Coolidge to visit Deadwood. He opted to travel by plane, and was pleased that the flight from Rapid City to Chicago took four and a half hours as opposed to the two months it took to cross the Overland Trail. His appearance back East attracted a great deal of press interest, and the many scars that attested to Deadwood Dick’s violent past fascinated journalists.

He was secretary of the American Red Cross Commission to Serbia, with assimilated rank of first lieutenant, and later captain, in the U.S. Army. He remained in the Balkans in relief and publicity activities for the ARC in 1918-19. Frantz worked for the United Press from 1920-65 (except during World War II) and was international editor of their Washington bureau from 1937-41. In 1941, he became associate director, and later director, of the press division of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson A. Rockefeller, in the Department of Commerce. When Rockefeller became Assistant Secretary of State for the American Republic, Frantz transferred to the State Department as information officer.\n\nFrantz returned to the United Press (later U.P.I.) foreign department in 1945 as a special correspondent, and until his retirement in 1965 he wrote frequently on Latin American affairs, both diplomatic and economic. In 1957, he received the Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University for &quot;outstanding achievement in the advancement of international friendship in the Americas,&quot; and in 1965, the Gold Medal of the U.S. Antarctic Service, Department of Defense, for his writings about Antarctica. The National Geographic Society made him a Jane N. Smith Life Member in 1943 in recognition of his &quot;pioneer travels by air throughout the world as a member of the first flights of American journalists.&quot; He was decorated by the French Army, and by the governments of Yugoslavia, Brasil, and Ecuador.\n\nCollection consists of 425 scrapbook binders containing clippings, awards, correspondence, photographs, reference files, news releases, and telegrams of Harry Warner Frantz, concerning World War I and relief administration after World War I; Stanford University student life; the Pacific region; the Philippine Islands, including Luzon; the Balkans; the American Red Cross; the American Field Service Commission; Yellowstone National Park; Latin America; the Caribbean region; diplomatic history, 1920-50; presidential elections, particularly 1932 and 1948; aviation; the Italian-Ethiopian War; the development of the United Nations; the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs; Nelson Rockefeller; naval and merchant marine developments in the postwar era; Antarctica; and the world economy. Also, photonegatives, correspondence, passports, notebooks, and a list of library books; includes c. 1920s aviation posters from Italy, Peru, and Hungary.\n\nFrom Stanford:\nBio:  Harry Warner Frantz attended Stanford University 1913-1917, 1919; he was a member of the Stanford Ambulance section during World War I (1917-1918). Frantz worked as a correspondent for United Press and contributed to various publications.\n\nCollection consists of Frantz's reminiscences of his years as a newspaperman and correspondent for United Press International; some correspondence with friends and colleagues; and copies of articles written by his wife or himself.

The gift was presented\nto Sergeant Woodfill on the stage of\nthe Keith's Palace Theater by Philip\nJ. McCook, Woodfill's friend and for-\nmer ranking officer. Together they\nburned the mortgage. This amounted\nto $8,000. Afterwards $5,000 in a paid\nup insurance policy was presented to\nSergeant Woodflll and the remainder\nwas left with Judge McCook as the\nnucleus of a trust fund for the war\nhero's benefit.\nThe mortgage burning was the cli-\nmax of the Armistice Day program,\nwhich began with the singing of the\nnational anthem, and a moment of\nsilent prayer for the departed heroes\nof the war. Senator J. Henry Walter\npresided, and General Bullard, General\nO'Ryan, Admiral Glennon and Father\nDuffy had seats of honor on the plat-\nform.

His father died shortly after his birth and Peddy spent much of his young adulthood supporting his mother. He then attended the University of Texas law school, where he served as student body president and led a protest against Governor James Edward Ferguson’s quarrels with the University. Though he was still a student, in 1917 he was elected to the Thirty-fifth Texas Legislature, but resigned to serve as a captain in the army during World War I. Upon Peddy’s graduation from law school in 1920, he practiced law in a private firm, served as assistant district attorney of Harris County, and became assistant U.S. attorney in charge of mail-fraud prosecutions.\n\nA staunch opponent of the Ku Klux Klan, Peddy, who had campaigned for Ferguson’s anti-Klan agenda, ran against Earle Bradford Mayfield (also a Democratic candidate, though a pro-Klan one) for senator in 1922, depending entirely on write-in votes.

The June 1921 issue of Talking Machine World states, &quot;A new instrument firm to be known as the Van Eps-Burr Corp. has been formed under the laws of the State of New York with a capital of $50,000. The incorporators are H.H. McClaskey [Burr], M.T. Kirkeby and F. Van Eps.&quot; The Van Eps Recording Banjo was modeled after the one he used in his recording and concert work. It had an aluminum resonator with a sound hole in the head, which was made of calfskin. He spent much time marketing and promoting the banjo, which remained on the market until around 1930. By then electric recording had become nearly universal and the loud volume produced by his model was no longer necessary.\n\nWalsh indicates in the December 1973 issue of Hobbies that Van Eps left the Eight Famous Victor Artists soon after a dispute with Burr about their banjo company. Walsh writes, &quot;The upshot was that Van Eps left the troupe and took over undivided operation of the banjo factory, while Burr engaged [Rudy] Wiedoeft in his place.&quot; Page 138 of the July 1922 issue of Talking Machine World states that Van Eps dropped out of the group in July 1922 because engagements in New York City prevented him from traveling.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.gracyk.com/fredvaneps.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.gracyk.com/fredvaneps.shtml</a>","Thanks,  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/artolog] !

She died July 17 of that year and was buried in Buffalo.

The Washington Senators, who were often referred to as the Nationals, played in the National League from 1892 to 1899. They were followed by another Washington Senators franchise in 1901, a charter member of the new American League, who were officially named the Washington Nationals from 1905 to 1956. \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals</a>","Is it possible to tell whether these houses were in Atlanta?

With the ruffles on the short and the collar style, might this person have played a role some decades before Senator Rice? --Helena","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress]  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05] The ruffles and cutaway tailcoat definitely suggested an earlier, founding fathers type figure, and I spent some time looking for pictures of Minnesota delegates to the constitutional convention and such but . . . 1) We on the coasts often forget that Minnesota history of the prosperous white male variety doesn't date back that far and I could find no Minnesotan signatories of the Declaration or the Constitution.  2) The figure is wearing floor length pleated  and creased trousers rather than breeches and a square cut four button vest with lapels rather than a colonial era long waistcoat. I think the ruffles and tailcoat represent evening dress rather than a colonial era figure.\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say this is one of the losing entries for the HMR statue in the Capitol. Given the time range of the Harris &amp; Ewing collection, the rough plaster finish that swanq points out, the rough board base it rests on and less than full scale it suggests, and the number &quot;3&quot; scrawled on both pedestal and statue, I imagine a row of these statues for the judges to inspect before committing to a full size marble version of the winning entry sometime between the commission in 1913 and the unveiling in 1916.  We know that there was a competition from the speeches at the unveiling in the Congressional Record\n\n<blockquote>This statue which we are about to unveil is the work of Prof. F. E. Triebel, of College Point, Long Island, a member of the Royal Academy of San Luca of Rome, Italy, who <b>was selected in competition with a large number of other artists,</b> and we feel gratified at the high order of talent and ability that he has displayed and with the work which he has produced. </blockquote>","I take your point. The use of the year 1849 on the seal in the model statue's pedestal, as well as the clothing style, made me wonder if the figure represented a man prominent in the 1830s and 1840s, rather than all the way back to the founding fathers. But the 1849 date fits well with Rice's biography as an advocate for establishing the MN Territory and then statehood. \n\nPhotographing a model intended for a statue at the US Capitol makes sense for Harris &amp; Ewing with their studio being in DC. In thinking about why H&amp;E would photograph a model, though, I still wonder if this might be Treibel's own model-- a preview of the statue to come as a matter of local news, with later changes in the clothing and what he holds in his hands. Or, perhaps H&amp;E photographed the finalists for the sculpture design and only this set of photos survived.  Way out on the speculation limb now :- ) --Helena","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress] I had not picked up on the 1849 in the seal.  That's very interesting.  Looking at the tiff, it's definitely the territorial seal rather than the state seal. I wonder why?

Other Statuary Hall pedestals from this period (early 20th century) used that same basic layout but are not so similar as these. That would lend credence to your theory that this was Triebel's own preliminary model.  Hmmmm. \n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/uscapitol/6264593280]\n\nOn the other hand, compare the mystery statue to this 1899 statuary hall figure of Thomas Hart Benton (Senator, not painter) carved by Alexander Doyle.

The scoops look very thin with no cutting edge. If it did scoop it would be dumping the product all over it self. It cannot be used for a liquid because of the cutouts in the scoops.

Greene in the picture.\n\nHarry Barber and William Greene were mechnical engineers working for Stephens-Adamson, a company that made a wide range of conveyors, loaders, scoops, dumpers, crushers, screens and washers, chutes, buckets, small manual hoists, and similar machinery for the coal and road-building industry.  They adapted their work to a wide range of industries, including mail handling, brewing, and package and freight delivery.\n\nA quick review of the type of machinery made by Stephens-Adamson indicates that this is something from the 1910s, most likely. I think that 1914 date is a few years too late, as most machinery was more advanced than what you see here.\n\nBarber and Green left Stephens-Adamson in 1916 to form their own industrial small-machinery firm. They initially focused on small tasks usually done by hand (shoveling) that could be mechanized. One of their first products was a mobile bucket loader for use in cement plants. The device looks too primitive to be 1914 or later. Even if this is only a model for the way the motor interacts with the gears, or the hoppers are designed to interact, the engineering looks too primitive for what was being made in 1916 when Barber-Greene was founded.\n\nThe Smithsonian has a collection of all of Barber-Greene's catalogs, which may prove useful.
