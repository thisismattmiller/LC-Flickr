Located in the San Joaquin Valley, about equidistant from Los Angeles and San Francisco, Visalia was already a thriving community of more than 1,000 inhabitants. Orval's father, Daniel, was a well-to-do businessman who owned the Palace Hotel in addition to a citrus farm, and Orval enjoyed an upper-class upbringing. After pitching and playing first base at Visalia High School, the 19-year-old Overall enrolled at the University of California-Berkeley in the fall of 1900. He excelled in his studies of agricultural science and was elected president of the freshman class.\n\nOverall was a star in both football and baseball at Cal. On the gridiron he played guard, fullback, and punter on the varsity, serving as captain as a senior. In his junior and senior years he played integral roles in California's victories over archrival Stanford. In baseball Orval performed the majority of the mound work as a freshman, pitching well but suffering from occasional mental lapses. Perhaps an early indicator of the arm troubles that would plague him in later years, he missed time from pitching due to a sore arm in both his sophomore and junior seasons. During those times Overall played left field, first base, and sometimes even catcher, though he inevitably returned to pitching as the seasons wore on and his arm rounded into shape. In his junior year he entertained an offer to play baseball for a living with the San Francisco club of the Pacific Coast League, but he decided to continue his education instead.</i>","May you all have a blessed, warm, and Happy New Year!!!\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vc_vigilant/3152849175/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3152849175_9cdd7ee751_m.jpg\" width=\"187\" height=\"240\" alt=\"May You Keep The Home Fires Burning in 2009!!!\" /></a>","Orval was my great-uncle.

Rudolf took Mary to his hunting castle Mayerling, where their bodies were found behind a locked door on January 30th 1889, both with a bullet to their heads.

Rudolf never got along with his father, the emperor Franz Josef and was even said to have been offered the crown of Hungary, should that country try to ceceed from Austria-Hungary.

However, the Justice photo and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3120288763/\">the sitting portrait</a> do look like the same person, so if the Bain collection mislabeled one, it must have mislabeled both. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't find any other photos identified as Flora Wilson anywhere on the Internet for a comparison, nor can I find any photos identified as Mrs. Tinnin, other than the two in the Bain Collection and the one at the top of the National Waterways article. \n\nAnother puzzle to be solved.","I think this is, in fact, Mrs. Tinnin (not Miss Wilson).  In looking through  Prints and Photographs Division photographs that are not digitized, I was able to find another portrait of Mrs. Tinnin--same features (though the person who had recorded the copyright deposit photograph in 1913 wrote the name as &quot;Tinnan, Mrs. Glenda S.&quot;!).  I also found a photograph of Flora Wilson in Prints and Photographs Division files, and another portrait of her is featured in the Washington Post (March 5, 1909, p. 5).  Miss Wilson had a somewhat rounder face, less deep-set eyes, and differently shaped eyebrows.\n\nWhich is not to say that the labeling on the suffrage parade/pageant  photos is always accurate.

His first Ministerial post was at Syracuse, New York.\n\nIn 1898, he moved to South Africa (Transvaal), to the Witwatersrand Old Hebrew Congregation, Johannesburg. He stayed there until 1911, despite attempts by President Paul Kruger in 1899 to expel him for his pro-British sympathies and for advocating the removal of religious disabilities of Jews and Catholics in South Africa. He was also Professor of Philosophy at Transvaal University College (later known as the University of the Witwatersrand), 1906-8. In 1911, he returned to New York to the Orach Chayim Congregation.\n\n==Chief Rabbi==In 1913, Rabbi Hertz was appointed Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire; his rival candidates had included Rabbi Moses Hyamson and Rabbi Bernard Drachman. Rabbi Hertz held the post until his death. His period in office was marked by many arguments with a wide variety of people, mainly within the Jewish community; the Dictionary of National Biography describes him as a &quot;combative Conservative&quot;. It was said of him that he was in favour of resolving disagreements by calm discussion - when all other methods had failed.","best shot","From the description, he sounded like the kind of man who would argue 'till it...

In the 1913 book <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/mexicolandofunre00baerrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mexico, The Land of Unrest</a>, it was portrayed as a vile, filthy prison easily ten times over capacity, and housing political prisoners as well as murderers.  In February of 1913, the long-running revolution in Mexico spilled into the capital.  Amid the conflict, Belem prison was shelled and five to six thousand convicts ran free.  A photo in the Bain collection shows <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?pp/PPALL:@field(DOCID+@lit(ggb2005015862))\" rel=\"nofollow\"> the walls fallen and a large hole</a> can be seen in the main buildings.  In a photo on page 14 of The Land of Unrest, government troops shoot from behind the collapsed wall.\n\nSo what building is this?\n\nWritten on the image is certainly &quot;Belem prison Mexico&quot; and &quot;Palacio penal de Belem&quot;.  But the <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?pp/PPALL:@field(DOCID+@lit(ggb2005012529))\" rel=\"nofollow\">high resolution TIFF</a> from LC’s site shows text chiseled across the front of the building: &quot;Palacio de Justicia del Ramo Penal&quot;.  This is the Mexican Court of Justice.\n\nI can’t determine where this was in Mexico City or whether it still exists.  After the 1917 constitution, the highest court was replaced with Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación, whose new home was completed in 1929.  It is still in use, Flickr has photos <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/frecuenciaspopulares/3026167642/\"> with riot police</a> and reflected <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pepeli3/3118282992/\">in a window</a>.\n\nWhy was the Court of Justice newsworthy?  \n\nOn July 15, 1914 Francisco Carvajal became President of Mexico.  A shot-in-the-dark guess is that the photo ran because he had been president of the Court of Justice.  The Library of Congress has <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?pp/PPALL:@field(DOCID+@lit(2005690674))\" rel=\"nofollow\"> an unscanned photo with Carvajal and a peace commission in 1911</a>.\n\nBelem made it into the Washington Post and New York Times constantly in the 1910s.  Beyond simple criminals, any revolutionary, dignitary, capitalist, or journalist could find themselves jailed and perhaps put to death at a moment’s notice.  The slow smoldering revolution probably put the Court of Justice in US newspapers as well.\n\nPresident Victoriano Huerta had lost his final battle in Guadalahara to constitutionalist revolutionaries.  In early July 1914 Venustiano Carranza and his forces marched on Mexico City, led by Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, and Alvaro Obregon.  Huerta resigned as president and fled Mexico.  Carvajal was sworn in as his replacement, and served for a solid month until August 15, 1914, when he turned the government over to Carranza peacefully.\n\nA large number of articles ran about Francisco Carvajal [I had spelled this incorrectly as Carbajal, perhaps I picked that up from period US newspapers?] in the Washington Post and New York Times from July 12, 1914, until he departed on August 20 for America to hopefully return to his career as a lawyer.  In particular, July 12-19 has many biographical pieces and a couple of photographs.\n\nI found a number of interesting false positives while looking for a Belem prison of this design.\n\nIn the 1910s, criminals with long sentences were sent to the federal penitentiary, called Palacio de Lecumberri.  It was the other, better run prison in Mexico City.  It was closed in 1976 and since 1994 the building has housed the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/17685204@N07/2971165563/\">Archivo General de la Nación</a> (National Archives).\n\nThere is an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/g_cravioto/2346864432/\">older supreme court building</a> which houses the court library in Mexico City.\n\nIn Belem, the capital of the state of Para, Brazil, a former prison was converted into the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/elizabeth_misciasci/2477859069/\">Museu do Estado do Pará</a> (State Museum of Para).\n\nAlso in Belem, Brazil is <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31879042@N02/2984953486/\">Casa das Onze Janelas</a>, which now is home to a contemporary art museum and a restaurant <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/carla_igor/1368293981/\">Boteco das Onze Janelas</a>.  It was a mansion, but a couple of sites erroneously peg it as the town’s first prison.","This was the High Court Building, next to Belen Jail in Mexico City","@ciriaco, thank you for posting more information about this building!  It's tortured me for a year!\n\nDo you know where it would be in current Mexico City?  I assume it doesn't exist any more?","More or less where today is Revolución Elementary School Center: Balderas, Izazaga and Rio de la Loza lanes, and Balderas subway station, downtown Mexico City.","Thank you so much!  If I am reading my map of Mexico City correctly, Izazaga becomes Arcos de Belén at the junction with Balderas, right?  (does Arcos de Belén translate to Belen Prison??)\n\nDo you think the High Court Building itself was at the northeast corner of Balderas and Rio de la Loza?","Thank you both for puzzling out the identification of this building.  We will add the information when we update!","I've been researching this building a bit more.\n\nIt was inaugurated on May 6, 1900, with President Diaz in attendance.  It held criminal courts (juzgados de lo criminal y correccionales) for Belem Prison.  It was built on the edge of the Belem Prison site - hence the original photo title - and was referred to as an annex.\n\nI'm not sure how long it lasted.  It was surely damaged in the 1913 revolution.  In 1933 the entire prison was replaced with Revolution Elementary School, as @ciriaco mentioned.  It must have been very symbolic, because Belem had served as a girls school before being converted to a prison in the mid 1800s.","Now a days here is located Centro Escolar Revolución.  The block is surrounded by Arcos de\nBelen (north), Dr. Río de la Loza (south); General G. Hernández (east) and Balderas (west). Colonia Doctores, Deletgación Cuauhtemoc. In this picture is shown north-west corner of Arcos de Belén (left-to-right) and Balderas (foreground-to-background), where Metro Balderas Norte is found. The camera is facing southwards,  Therefore by shadows casting you can say the picture was taken in the morning by 9 am.\nYou may found this information if you go to Google Maps.\nDr. Roberto Duarte\nPlastic Surgeon\ndr.robertoduarte@hotmail.com","I don't think that this Bain photograph is about the Court of Justice, rather the agency wanted to show the Belem prison and got the wrong building. The photos nearby are around January to March 1913, so I think it was intended to illustrate the ecape of prisoners by the wrecking of the prison in February 1913, see e.g. <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92070581/1913-02-12/ed-1/seq-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Albuquerque evening herald., February 12, 1913, Image 1</a>, col. 1.\n\nA correct photo of Belem prison (I presume) is in <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064430/1914-04-18/ed-1/seq-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Madison journal., April 18, 1914, Image 3</a>.","caption reads:\n\n&quot;MEXICO CITY, MEXICO, YMCA Reading Room (1910)&quot;\n\nWhich makes the caption and date on this one pretty easy.","Thanks.

She read Shakespeare and particularly identified with the teenage Juliet. She enjoyed a long run at the Hudson Theater in New York City. A particular favorite of audiences was her performance in David Belasco's Poor Little Rich Girl, when she was 16. She went into vaudeville with Dustin Farnum in The Little Rebel and played a bit part in The Model by Augustus Thomas.\n\nDana entered films in 1910. Her first motion picture was made at a former Manhattan (New York) riding academy on West 61st Street. The stalls had been transformed to dressing rooms. Dana became a star with the Edison Company, working at their studio in the Bronx. She fell in love with Edison director John Hancock Collins (1889 - 1918) and they married in 1915. Dana's success in Collins's Edison features such as Children of Eve (1915) and The Cossack Whip (1916) encouraged producer B. A. Rolfe to offer the couple lucrative contracts with his company, Rolfe Photoplays, which released through Metro Pictures Corporation. Dana and Collins accepted Rolfe's offer in 1916 and made several important films for Rolfe/Metro, notably The Girl Without A Soul and Blue Jeans (both 1917). Rolfe closed his New York-area studio down in the face of the 1918 influenza epidemic and sent most of his personnel to California. Dana left before Collins, who was finishing work at the studio; however, Collins contracted influenza which rapidly turned into pneumonia and died in a New York hotel room on October 23, 1918.\n\nDana remained in California acting for Metro. In 1920 she became engaged to Ormer Locklear, a daring aviator and military veteran. Locklear died when his plane crashed on August 2, 1920 during a nighttime film shooting. (Dana witnessed the crash. She would not fly again for 25 years.) Locklear was the prototype for the Robert Redford movie, The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), and Dana was an honored guest for the premiere of The Great Waldo Pepper.\n1928\n\nDana continued to act throughout the 1920s, but her popularity gradually waned. One of her last important roles was in Frank Capra's first film for Columbia Pictures, That Certain Thing (1928). She retired from the screen in 1929. Her final screen credits are roles in Two Sisters (1929), One Splendid Hour (1929), and (with her sister Shirley Mason, nee Leonie Flugrath) The Show of Shows (1929). By the time she made her final film appearance, she had appeared in over 100 films. More than 50 years after her retirement from the screen she appeared in the documentary Hollywood (1980), discussing her career as a silent film star during the 1920s. Footage from the interview sessions was used in the 1987 documentary Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow.\n\nViola Dana died in 1987 from heart failure, aged 90. She is interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery under her original name of Virginia Flugrath.\n\nViola Dana has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to motion pictures. It is located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n[edit]","There are lots of great pictures of her here on the Silent Ladies and Gents website:\n<a href=\"http://silent-movies.org/Ladies/PDana.html\">Viola Dana Photo Gallery</a>","Nice!

The article is mostly about Robert M. McNaught Sr, who seems to have been a pretty well known NYPD officer.  But this article announces McNaught Sr's resignation in 1905, so if this picture is from the 1910s then I think it has to be Jr.","This, indeed, must be detective Robert M. McNaught Sr.'s son  Robert M. McNaught Jr.   The elder was born about 1847 and was married 1st to Elizabeth Betts and after her death to my great-grandaunt Caroline Haberman-McNaught.  Robert Sr. not only retired in 1905 but died about 1909.  The picture of this Robert McNaught is of someone too young looking to be in his 60's or 70's.  \n     Robert Jr. was born about 1875 to Robert Sr. and 1st. wife Elizabeth Betts.   Robert Sr. was quite a famous detective.  Any search in the NY Times archive will come up with numerous stories about his detective work and close association with the infamous DA's office.  The 2 articles about Robert Sr., one on the occasion of his retirement and the second his obituary gives a pretty  good idea of how active Robert Sr. was from about 1870 when he entered the force till his retirement in 1909.

Frederick Converse Beach was the son of Alfred Ely Beach, developer of the <a href=\"http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/beach.html\">pneumatic subway</a>, a short section of which was built in the city in 1869. The Beach family was long associated with Scientific American Magazine, and Frederick was the magazine's editor, as well as Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia Americana. I can't find anything about a Mrs. Frederick C. Beach on the Internet, though their son, Stanley Yale Beach, comes up in searches.\n\nThere's a great deal of information about a Mrs. Frederick O. Beach, though. Her Fred Beach was, according to the New York Times article about <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE6D8173DE433A2575AC2A9679D94689ED7CF\">their 1899 wedding</a>, a &quot;popular clubman&quot; and was &quot;associated in business with the Beckwith-Chandler Company.&quot; This Mrs. Beach, born Miss Camilla Moss, was the widow of Charles F. &quot;Carley&quot; Havemeyer, who died of a gunshot wound in 1898- an &quot;accident&quot; according to the coroner's inquest as reported in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9405E5DA143CE433A25752C1A9639C94699ED7CF\">the Times article about the incident</a>. Both of these articles suggest that the Havemeyer's marriage may have been somewhat troubled. \n\nMrs. Frederick O. Beach was in the news again in 1912 and 1913. While the couple were vacationing in the resort town of Aiken, South Carolina, she was attacked in her yard, receiving a serious neck  wound. Rumors circulated that it was her husband who had stabbed her. A few weeks later, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E6D6143CE633A2575AC0A9629C946396D6CF\">Fred Beach was formally charged</a> for the attack.\n\nHis trial was not held until  February, 1913, when The Times published <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9805E5D9103CE633A25756C0A9649C946296D6CF\">this story</a> about it. A few days later, The Times announced that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D05E4D7163FE633A2575BC0A9649C946296D6CF\">Mr. Beach had been acquitted</a>.\n\nI can find nothing about the couple after 1913. Presumably, they resumed their former placid life- or returned to their private hell, as the case may have been. One result from a Google search on their names is a brief mention of a Mr. and Mrs. Fred Beach attending a society wedding in 1930, but I don't know if it refers to the same couple.","Frederick Converse Beach (son of Alfred Ely Beach) was married to Margaret Allen Gilbert (1848-1932). Their son Stanley Yale Beach had a son named Frederick Converse Beach II who died in 1940. I believe Frederick Converse Beach II had a son, Frederick Converse Beach Jr. (who died at age 3) by his wife Sarah B (per FCB, Jr.'s gravestone). There is also a gravestone in Union Cemetery in Stratford, CT for a Matilda Florence Sparling who is listed as Frederick C Beach II's wife. This picture could potentially be any of these women (Margaret, Sarah, Matilda).","The Salt Lake Tribune reported on the Beach trial in 1913. Chronicling America has the images of the original newspaper account.\n\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045396/1913-02-03/ed-1/seq-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trial to Clear Beach Case Mystery</a>\n\nI haven't read far enough ahead to see how the case came out, but apparently Mrs. Beach accused an unidentified &quot;Negro&quot; of the assault, but the State felt differently. The State accused Mr. Frederick O. Beach of assaulting his wife after following her to what he believed was a tryst with a neighbor.","Thanks billy_pilgrim: From the photo in the Salt Lake Tribune, it looks like this could be Mrs. Frederick O.

Once the escapee's neck was trapped between the spiked ring, they had incentive to stop running.

On December 30th, 32 officials of the International Assocation of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers were sentenced to Federal prison by Judge Anderson for their part in the &quot;dynamite conspiracy&quot;.  \n\n Thirty-two &quot;dynamiters&quot; under arrest were transported from the Marion County Jail in Indianapolis by an equal number of deputies under Marshal Schmidt.  They marched south on Alabama Street to the Virginia Avenue viaduct where they boarded a special train.  A squad of Indianapolis Police was also on hand.  They were transported to Leavenworth Prison via St. Louis.  Source:  Indianapolis Star, December 31, 1912 and January 1, 1913.","According the the 1/1/1913 Washington Post (page 3 &quot;Prison train on Way&quot;), the train left Indianapolis and headed to the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas.  This was a special prison train with two passenger coaches and one baggage car that departed at 12:10 in the afternoon.  33 convictec conspirators were transported at once.\n\nThe train carried the nickname &quot;dynamiters' special&quot;.  It was boarded at a siding near the county jail.  US Marshals and news reporters accompanied the prisoners.\n\nAccording to the 1/3/1913 Washington Post (p1 &quot;Plotters in 'Pen'&quot;) the train was greeted by cheering crowds at every station, though the trip was supposed to be somewhat secret.  Midnight was spent passing Jefferson County, Missouri, where the prisoners were allowed to drink coffee to celebrate the new year.  \n\nNear Kansas City they passed a rail road bridge which the dynamiters had blown up as part of their conspiracy.  Ironically, &quot;almost the first question on entering the penetentiary was about the library&quot; -- they <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163454120/\">blew up part of the Hawthorne Library in Indianapolis</a>.","J.

Like shortstop Honus Wagner, a teammate of Lobert's when he first came to the major leagues, the German-American Lobert earned the nickname &quot;Hans&quot; as a familiar form of Johannes, the German version of his given name, and was dubbed &quot;Hans Number 2&quot; by Honus Wagner. Lobert batted only .274, but he played 14 seasons (1903, 1905-17) with five National League clubs, including regular stints as a third baseman for the Cincinnati Reds (1906-10) and Philadelphia Phillies (1911-14). He also played with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1903), Chicago Cubs (1905) and New York Giants (1915-17).\n\nDuring his career, Lobert was known as one of the fastest, if not the fastest, players in the game. He once raced a racehorse around the bases before a game.\n\nAfter managing in the minor leagues during the 1920s and early 1930s, Lobert became a coach for the Phillies from 1934 through 1941. At 60, he became one of the oldest rookie managers in baseball history when he was appointed skipper of the 1942 Phils, in the midst of the longest streak of futility in their history. Under Lobert, the club &quot;improved&quot; by losing only 109 games (they had lost 111 under Doc Prothro in 1941). Counting two losses as an interim manager in 1938, Lobert's career managing record was 42-111 (.275).\n\nAfter his one season at the Phillies' helm, Lobert's career in uniform ended as a Cincinnati coach (1943-44). He than became a scout for the Giants of New York and San Francisco, serving until his death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 86.\n\nSource:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lobert\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lobert</a>","Richard Arthur Norton: Thanks for the additional information on Lobert!

Any vertically plumb lines must line up as parallel lines visually and these do not.  It is possible that both buildings are &quot;leaning&quot; and the apparent amount is a cumulative effect.  The only other possible explanation is that the front planes of one or both of these two buildings are purposely built inclining but that does not seem to be the case. The nearest of those two buildings is composed of a columned front in tiered vertical groupings.\n\nTo the left in the photo the columned buildings facing the circle in a concave front are very impressive.  They remind one of some of the structures of ancient Rome.

He played for the 1915 Phillies team that lost to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, and after the 1917 season, he was traded to the Cubs with Grover Cleveland Alexander for two players and $55,000 in cash. In 1918 he played in another World Series, losing again to the Red Sox. He retired from playing at age 33 in 1921, becoming the manager of the Cubs shortly after. He was fired after 75 games in 1923, and after five years away from managing, he was hired by the Browns in 1930, with little success, never finishing above fifth place. His managerial record was 524-622 (.457) in nine seasons.\n\nHe died in Elsmere, Delaware, at age 72.","Grandfather of Obama administration's Nancy Killefer.","Eppa Rixey (1891-1963):\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppa_Rixey\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppa_Rixey</a>\n\nOdd name, but it was his father's name--and his son was Eppa Rixey III.

young woman in the image, was a major celebrity in her day.  She started modeling in her early teens for many prominent artists, went on to become one of the famous &quot;Gibson Girls&quot;, and also launched her own acting career. \n\n At the very young age of 17, she was 'seduced' (today we'd call this rape) by highly-known and influential architect, Stanford White, of the architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White.  For many years thereafter, Nesbit, her mother, and her brother were the beneficiaries of financial support from White.  Nesbit eventually married multi-millionaire, unstable and violent, Harry Thaw.  Thaw had been obsessed for many years with architect S White, believing him to be committed to ruining his (Thaw's) reputation.  When Nesbit revealed to Thaw (who himself had battered and assaulted her on occasions), Thaw became determined to kill S White.  This he did, in public, shooting White in the face with a pistol, in around, I believe, 1910.  Thaw's trial for the murder of White was very big news at the time, and reported extensively in all papers around the country.  \n\nThaw was tried twice; during the first trial, a hung jury resulted, during the second, he was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity and committed to an institution for the insane (from which he later escaped).  \n\nNesbit was forced to testify at both trials and to repeat lurid and provocative details of her relations (sexual and otherwise) with both men.  After this point, her reputation was irrevocably ruined, and, after being rejected by Thaw's extremely wealthy but cold and bizarre family, she struggled to support herself for the rest of her surprisingly long life:  Nesbit lived until the late 60's.  \n\nHard to believe a life spanning so much change in American society!\n\nHer face should look familiar:  drawings, painting, prints of all kinds were made of her by many artists and designers throughout her youth, and one can still find these frequently reproduced.  One of the most well-known images of her is the profile drawing in black and white of a young, beautiful woman of the times, her hair piled upon her head and trailing down the back of her neck in a manner that resembles a question mark.  This print was entitled, &quot;The Eternal Question&quot;.","The workmanship on this jacket is absolutely amazing.  Most likely created from a nicely woven wool.  The bond buttonholes would have been made by hand.  The times were filled with people who would be our current day &quot;Makers&quot;.  Maybe the hat was a &quot;Hack&quot;.","The fashion she is wearing could only have been created by her contemporary &quot;Makers&quot; and &quot;Hackers&quot;.  I think that hat is a &quot;remix&quot;.","@Sue, I'm confused by your comments.  Are you suggesting that the hat Nesbit wears in the original photo is not authentic, but was somehow photoshopped?  Far more elaborate hats were worn in Nesbit's day.

He was commissioned by Ronald McNeill, 1st (and last) Lord Cushendun, and his Cornish wife Maud to create a setting with a Cornish theme. So the houses, built between 1912 and 1925, are of rugged white-washed stone with roofs of slate. Williams-Ellis also designed Lord Cushendun's large neo-Georgian house, fronted by an odd five arch arcade, which is now a home for the elderly.

They used the name Dodgers during the 1912 season (and maybe 1911- sources differ), but returned to their earlier name for the 1913 season. In 1914 they became the Brooklyn Robins, and then restored the name Dodgers in 1916. \n\nHowever, some sources say the team officially remained the Robins into the early 1930s.

This occurred in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia and created a ‘turf-war’ between the rival leagues. Many players ‘jumped’ leagues following larger salary offers, fostering a feeling of discontent between principles on both sides. The American League Baltimore franchise pondered a shift in home venue to New York (they would become the Yankees), furthering this simmering dispute. The manager of the National League New York Giants, John McGraw, commented to the press “the Philadelphia club is not making any money. It has a big white elephant on its hands.” Mr. McGraw’s pejorative statement of “white elephant” implied something odd, worthless and undesirable. Interestingly, Mr. McGraw had just himself ‘jumped’ from the American League Baltimore franchise to the New York National League franchise. Connie Mack, Philadelphia Athletics’ manager, and Ben Shibe the owner of the A’s defiantly adopted the white elephant as their mascot. The Philadelphia Athletics found success on the field and at the box office; the franchise was anything but a white elephant.

Like shortstop Honus Wagner, a teammate of Lobert's when he first came to the major leagues, the German-American Lobert earned the nickname &quot;Hans&quot; as a familiar form of Johannes, the German version of his given name, and was dubbed &quot;Hans Number 2&quot; by Honus Wagner. Lobert batted only .274, but he played 14 seasons (1903, 1905-17) with five National League clubs, including regular stints as a third baseman for the Cincinnati Reds (1906-10) and Philadelphia Phillies (1911-14). He also played with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1903), Chicago Cubs (1905) and New York Giants (1915-17).\n\nDuring his career, Lobert was known as one of the fastest, if not the fastest, players in the game. He once raced a racehorse around the bases before a game.\n\nAfter managing in the minor leagues during the 1920s and early 1930s, Lobert became a coach for the Phillies from 1934 through 1941. At 60, he became one of the oldest rookie managers in baseball history when he was appointed skipper of the 1942 Phils, in the midst of the longest streak of futility in their history. Under Lobert, the club &quot;improved&quot; by losing only 109 games (they had lost 111 under Doc Prothro in 1941). Counting two losses as an interim manager in 1938, Lobert's career managing record was 42-111 (.275).\n\nAfter his one season at the Phillies' helm, Lobert's career in uniform ended as a Cincinnati coach (1943-44). He than became a scout for the Giants of New York and San Francisco, serving until his death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 86.\n\nSource:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lobert\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lobert</a>","Richard Arthur Norton: Thanks for the additional information on Lobert!

[...]\n\nHarry Vallon was Man Friday to Bridgie Webber, who owned a poker room at the northwest corner of Forty-second Street and Sixth Avenue, a notorious and crooked trap frequented by Becker and never raided. He was also Webber's partner in various stuss houses (stuss was a simplified version of faro, known on New York's East Side as Jewish faro).\n\nThese three men told Shapiro to take them to Seventh Avenue and 145th Street, where they picked up Frank Cirofici, known as Dago Frank, small, hard, and poisonous in a deceptively quiet way, who was a stick-up man and gunman. He was often seen in company of Kid Benson, a big-time Harlem gambler he frequently protected, and his gun was also at the disposal of Big Jake Zelig's East Side gang.&quot;\n\nAccording to this article, Vallon came into the police station to deny being involved in the killing. He spent some time in jail, and at one point Becker clamed Vallon had pulled the trigger, but in the end four other men were convicted of the murder, and Becker of hiring them.","See <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2850362519/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2850362519/</a>","This was quite a sensational case and there are many photos on LOC Flickr related to it.

Giants fans stormed the Polo Grounds field, and in the chaos that ensued a Cubs player stood on second base with the ball. After a hasty conference, the umpires ruled that Merkle never touched second base and was ruled out on a force play. The game ended in a tie, rather than a Giants win, and the Cubs went on to win the pennant and the 1908 World Series.

Her IMDB bio says:\n\n<i>&quot;Daughter of a Danish count and diplomat, Carl Adam Greve von Moltke, and wife Mabel Wilson, and paternal granddaughter of Carl Greve von Moltke (1869-1935) and his American wife Cornelia Van Rensselaer Thayer, who had some Dutch American ancestry.&quot;</i>\n\nCould this be Carl Greve von Moltke &amp; his wife Cornelia?","The Moltke family was quite large, with branches in Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

Helmuth James Graf von Moltke was arrested in 1944 and executed by the Gestapo in 1945. He is the subject of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_James_Graf_von_Moltke\">Wikipedia article</a>.\n\nCount von Moltke's wife was the former Dorothy Rose-Innes, daughter of the South African Jurist Sir James Rose-Innes.","There were two Moltke's who were very important German military officers, Chief of Staff both, elder one was uncle of younger one.

The uncle did not inherit the title of Graf (Count), but it was granted to him in 1870, for the services he rendered to the nation. The nephew never held a comital title, and thus could not be the Count in this Bain photo.\n\nIf this photo does not depict a Danish Greve (Count) Moltke (about whom I can find nothing on the Internet), then he must be the heir of Wilhelm Graf von Moltke (1845-1905), whose ancestral title was tied to the ownership of Kreisau. As Helmuth Graf von Moltke zu Kreisau was born in 1876 (and would have inherited the title on the death of his father in 1905), and as his son, Helmuth James, was born in 1907, they would have been the apparent ages of the two Moltkes in this ca. 1910 photo.","This NYTimes article talks about a Danish count <b>Carl Moltke</b> who was the Danish minister to the US, who is being transferred to Berlin (August 7, 1912)\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9504E2DB123CE633A25754C0A96E9C946396D6CF&amp;scp=10&amp;sq=Count+\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9504E2DB123CE633A...</a>\n\nthere was also a famous German naval ship named the Moltke, info here:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Moltke_(1910)\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Moltke_(1910)</a>","An excellent discovery!

This glove in the photo has longer fingers than most gloves of that time.  The ball was not wound as tight as it is today, thus making it a bit softer, what they called the Dead Ball.  Therefore, there were few home runs hit and many of the ones that were hit were inside the park.  Batters tended to face the pitcher more so that they could see the ball better and then punch at the ball trying to place it between the fielders.  The bats had thicker handles, also.  Overall, the players were smaller and not as athletic as they are today.  They didn't believe in muscle building and conditioning like today's players.  In fact, weight training was discouraged because it was felt one would become &quot;muscle bound&quot; and not be able to throw well.  This attitude was still popular into the 1960's.  I can remember coaches also telling us to not go swimming because it would tire us out for baseball.  At any rate, I find it interesting that the bases are still 90 feet apart and the batter is usually always thrown out on a ball hit to any infielder, just as in circa 1900.  Today's players are faster, have better equipment, are more physical, but it is still a game of inches.  Ruth came along and changed the game.  Players started to swing for the fences like the Babe.  The ball was wound tighter and other sluggers such as Jimmy Foxx and Hack Wilson emerged.\n\nThanks for these great old photos.","Here is a bit of trivia once told to me years ago by Bill Eberly who had been the Milwaukee Braves business manager.  Duffy Lewis once pinch hit for Babe Ruth.","This is a true testatment to the times in which this photo was taken.

They cycled out to Whitstone from their employer's office in Holsworthy, about 8 miles, and were admitted by her father Dr Wharry.

They are “lightning sketches’’ of members of the club, made while they were on their feet, speaking. They show the members as Mr Flagg imagined they might look in 1940. It was a unique feat of the imagination, and Mr. Flagg perhaps has opened a new field of art. It is not unusual for persons who have their portraits painted to want twenty or thirty years taken from their age by the painter. Shall we develop a fad for futurities in portraiture? If so, Mr. Flagg can claim to be the pioneer. The cleverness of these cartoons, as shown by comparison with the originals. appears all the more striking when it is known that Mr. Flagg did them while on his feet at an easel, without preparation, and that each of them consumed but a few minutes In its execution. \n\nThese are representatives of some eight or ten sketches which Mr. Flagg did during the course of the dinner, including future portraits of Thomas L. Masson of Life, J. O. H. Cosgrave of Everybody's, Orson Lowell, Ellis Jones, Ellis Parker Butler, W. O. Inglis of Harper’s. These cartoons are of Burges Johnson, the humorist, and George Grantham Bain, the magazine writer and syndicate manager. \n\nThe Dutch Treat club is a unique organization.

And <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bstrong/292792682/\">here</a> is a photo of a KRIT car with the symbol from another Flickr user. Looking at the photo large, I can see a similar logo above the radiator on this car--seems to identify it as a KRIT car. Perhaps some car fanatic out there can tell us the exact model.\n\nThis use of the swastika symbol, of course, predates its adoption by Nazi Germany--it was a widespread symbol in many cultures, see, for instance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> and <a href=\"http://history1900s.about.com/cs/swastika/a/swastikahistory.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">history1900s.about.com/cs/swastika/a/swastikahistory.htm</a>. The latter has a good summary of its use at the time of this photo:\n\n<i>Even in the early twentieth century, the swastika was still a symbol with positive connotations. For instance, the swastika was a common decoration that often adorned cigarette cases, postcards, coins, and buildings. During World War I, the swastika could even be found on the shoulder patches of the American 45th Division and on the Finnish air force until after World War II.</i>","The swastika is a symbol which predates the third reich by a millennium or two. It's an ancient buddhist symbol, and many aboriginal American tribes used it.","I don't believe this is a K-R-I-T motor car. It's an open-top bus. K-R-I-T didn't make unusual vehicles like this. They made mainly small automobiles, like Roadsters and Runabouts. Their cars had small swastikas on their bronze hub caps, with the word K-R-I-T in large bronze letters across the front of the radiator. The top of the radiator shell was peaked, not flat, like the one on the bus in this photo. See the photo of the 1910 model in the Detroit News article mentioned above. The 1912 models were almost identical.  Moreover, car makers didn't paint large corporate logos on the sides of the hoods.\n\nSomething else is going on here. This bus has a number 10 on the side of the front seat, suggesting it's part of a fleet. The swastika could be the logo of a local transportation company.","Here are some scans of genuine K-R-I-T trade literature from around 1910:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/15283643@N04/3964040987/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/15283643@N04/3964041145/]\n\nI don't see any connection.","Technogeo--you are absolutely correct about the &quot;radiator ornament&quot;--that is a man's hand, holding a cigar, not a swastika! This is obvious, now that it is pointed out, but the illusion is quite something.\n\nEdit: I corrected the Wikipedia article, referencing this discussion","Thanks cotinis! The next task is to figure out the real make of this vehicle. It looks like an early truck chassis. The front end looks a bit like a 1906 REO.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fritsklijn/3654963032/in/pool-reo_vehicles\">www.flickr.com/photos/fritsklijn/3654963032/in/pool-reo_v...</a>\n\nThere is a cropped photo of a &quot;1909 open-top Rapid sight-seeing bus&quot; used in Denver in a book by Floyd Clymer. It doesn't show the front end, but the back end is similar in some ways: 5 bench seats behind the driver, a right-hand steering wheel, and solid rubber tires. Much wider body, though. It extends over the rear wheels.","Yes, and one must wonder about the logo on the side. Surely, somewhere, there is information on a NYC bus company with that as the logo. It seems to have been pretty widespread at the turn of the century as a generic good luck sign used for many commercial concerns. Perhaps a judicious search of the New York Times archives will reveal something interesting.\n\nI'm still laughing at myself seeing what I was looking for in the large image--that is just so easy to do.","Here's another clue, from page 3 of the NY Times, October 23, 1912: Finish Testimony in Becker Case\n\n&quot;The faces of the jurors gave no indication yesterday as to whether or not they had made up their minds on the case. Each man as he passed from the jury box to the waiting sightseeing automobile which conveyed them to the Murray Hill Hotel, seemed thoroughly conscious of the responsibility which rested upon him.&quot;","The building next to the vehicle is the Manhattan Criminal Courts Bldg., next to the Tombs Prison. The vehicle and passengers are facing the 'Bridge of Sighs' on Franklin Street. There was another 'Bridge of Sighs' ,taller and shorter on White St. Centre St. is in the background. For a view of both bridges see middle photo   <a href=\"http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?718586F\" rel=\"nofollow\">digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?718586F</a>","@technogeo  Of course KRIT didn't build any cars like this, the vehicle is clearly the work of a coach builder.  During this time not many manufacturers were making chassis that I'm aware of the coach builders would have to convert an actual vehicle.  So it's not outside the realm of possibility that this is in fact a KRIT (the time period is right and the symbol is there) and was converted by a coach builder.","WG Finley: There's no evidence that KRIT built a truck chassis with RH drive and a completely different radiator shell. Also, the symbol is too large and conspicuous to be that of an auto maker. I still believe it's the logo of a local transit company, painted on the side of an import from England or France. We need to track down the owner of the NY licence plate 45139.

Morse (1855?-1933), a speculator and stock promoter who was 49 years old in 1904, at the time his second marriage was annulled, as described in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E5DB143DE631A2575BC0A9679C946597D6CF\">this New York Times article</a>. The article describes Morse as &quot;...the promoter of the American Ice Company and an officer of about thirty banks and other corporations in this and other cities.&quot; It also notes that he had been a widower with three sons and a daughter. Perhaps the dapper young fellows flanking him in this photo were two of his sons?\n\nMorse had a hand in the Panic of 1907, during which stocks on the New York exchange lost half their value. In 1908, Morse was convicted of misappropriating funds of the Bank of North America. He was sentenced to federal prison, though he did not begin serving his term until 1910. Early in 1912, he managed to convince physicians that he was near death, and President Taft commuted his sentence (<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0DE7DE173CE633A2575AC1A9679C946396D6CF\">&quot;MORSE PARDONED IN DEATH'S SHADOW&quot;</a> cried the New York Times headline on January 19, 1912. After his release, Morse miraculously recovered, and went on to outlive Taft by three years (and to be depicted in this Bain photo, which appears to date from 1915.) \n\nThough Morse has no Wikipedia article, Taft's biographer Henry Pringle devoted considerable space to the Morse affair, with lots of background information about Morse himself, and this section of Pringle's 1939 book can currently be read online <a href=\"http://www.doctorzebra.com/Prez/z_x27morse_g.htm\">on this web page</a>.","漂亮ㄉ圖<a href=\"http://a101.zzndy.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">.</a><a href=\"http://a102.zzndy.info/\"

Infection of the wound would really be the only serious concern if this is the only linkage between the two children.  The smaller girl probably died just due to the fact she was more frail and perhaps had some other internal problems.\n\nAlso, I am thinking that the photo was taken before the children were given a general, just to show how the surgeon was going to make his incision.","I agree that this is definitely staged.

In 1876, she left Albion to attend Boston Theological Seminary. Upon graduation, in 1878, as the only woman in her class, she took charge of a church in East Dennis, Massachusetts, but the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church refused her application for ordination because she was a woman.

They appear to have evaded Google . . . .","After a false start (see my comment on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2422674739/\">this photo of Young Britt and Kid Williams</a>), I've been able to identify both of the boxers in this photo, thanks to the book &quot;Baltimore's Boxing Legacy&quot; by Thomas Schaif (Mount Pleasant, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 2003.) On page 7  it says:<blockquote>&quot;On Bond Street, just around the corner from Fleet, stands the building where Johnny Gutenko became Kid Williams. In a small room behind a confectionery store&mdash;run by Tom the Greek&mdash;Williams learned to box with the help of local boxer Young Britt.&quot;</blockquote> This identifies the Young Britt in this photo as the bantamweight born in 1890 whose real name was Henry Treffinger (<a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=55976&amp;cat=boxer\">bout list at BoxRec</a>.)\n\nKid Williams (1893-1963) was born John Gutenko in Copenhagen, Denmark. In his long ring career he fought more than 200 bouts, winning 156 of them, and held the title of  Bantamweight Champion of the World from 1914 to 1917 (<a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=17248&amp;cat=boxer\">bout list at BoxRec</a>.)","Looking at other photos of Kid Williams (I haven't found any non-LOC photos of Young Britt), I'm wondering if Bain got the identities switched. Look at these photos of Kid Williams from <a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:17248\">BoxRec</a> and from <a href=\"http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/williams-k.htm\">Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia</a>. See the other LOC photo I linked to in my comment above, too, which shows both boxers from their other side. To my eye, the photos of Williams from the other sites both more closely resemble the blond on the right in this photo and the left in the other Bain photo than they do the darker fellow identified in the Bain captions as Williams. \n\nThere are also photos of Williams on page 8 and page 53 of the Thomas Schaif book I cite in my previous comment. They are definitely the same blond  guy on the BoxRec and Cyber Boxing pages, so any error is not theirs. I'm pretty sure Bain's captioner got this wrong. Anybody else see the resemblances I do?","whyaduck: Thanks for all of your research on these boxers. We'll add the information to our source catalog.

It convinces me that whoever put the caption onto these negatives reversed the identities. \n\nNote that the photos from the other sites show that Kid Williams parted his (light) hair on the right, and Young Britt parted his (dark) hair on the left. Other features (forehead height, nose shape, jawline, ear size and shape) strongly indicate a reversal as well.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2422674739]\n\n\nPossibly:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Williams\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Williams</a>\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2968837871/]","text is legible on the monument and it refers to <b>Samuel Pierpont Langley</b>, Secretary of the <b>Smithsonian Institution</b>.

James W. was not a founder of the conservation movement, except indirectly. He was the father of Amos, Antoinette, and Amos Pinchot. Gifford was encouraged by his father to study forestry, so Gifford, who went on to found the Forest Service in 1905, credited his father with being the &quot;Father of Forestry.&quot; But James was a wealthy New York businessman, not a lumber baron.

Later he was a referee at Madison Square Garden, and a trainer. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/savage_jim.htm\">Thumbnail biography from The Cyber Boxing Zone</a>.","Jim Savage was a professional heavy weight boxer from 1898 to 1917.  He fought over 120 fights around the world.   He also did two silent films.  Early in his career he sparred with Bob Fitzsimmons because Bob liked the speed of Jim and it was good for Bob in his later years. Fitzsimmonas became Jim's mentor and Jim lived with Fitzsimmons for a while. After his retirement from the ring he became the Athletic Director for the Motion Picture Club in NYC as well as a referee at Madision Square Garden (most notable) and other Athletic clubs in NY and NJ.   During his retirement he became the personal trainer and bodyguard for the tin can magnate, Daniel G. Reid.  Jim traveled with Reid for many years.  Jim Savage died in 1946 in Orange, N.J.","Found a reference to Peter Gotz in the following of the history of commonwealth wrestling:\n\nIn 1904 the USA held the Olympic Games in St. Louis and had included wrestling but only Free-style. The problems of distance, expense and the lack of Greco-Roman meant that no European wrestlers travelled to the USA, so the competition was in effect a re-run of the American Championships.\n\nThe decisive year for Catch-as-catch-can in the drive to establish it as a world sport was1908; three major events took place that year in London, which confirmed the sport’s international status. The Alhambra Tournament which finished on February 1st, the Hengler’s Circus Tournament, which commenced in May 6th and lasted eight weeks and a couple of weeks later the Olympic Games.\n\nThe National Sporting Club, England’s most influential sporting body, had decided to put some order into the often farcical newspaper claims of ‘world’ or ‘British’ or ‘Empire’ champion by organising a strictly enforced and legitimate professional World Championship in three weight categories. Lord Lonsdale the fifth Earl of Lonsdale (1857/1944) was the President of the National Sporting Club and all the officials in the tournament were amateur; among them was A.H. Sutherland, Chairman of the National Amateur Wrestling Association. The event was to be held annually in the Alhambra Theatre in London and was the most important professional tournament in the drive to establish legitimate international Catch-as-catch-can championships, in the face of European pressure for Greco-Roman only. It was publicised as widely as the technology of the period would permit; Hackenschmidt, Yokio Tani (1881/1950) of Japan, Cherpillod of Switzerland and several other famous stars were invited but declined; basically because defeat would affect their lucrative music hall contracts.\n\nAs always happens in big tournaments there were some unexpected results, Peter Gotz (1887/1944) of Germany failed to make the weight at lightweight but placed second in the middleweights. Yamato Maida (1874/1944) from Hirosaki City in Japan, the best of the Japanese in Europe, and who was the man most responsible for the world wide spread of Judo was easily beaten by Henry Irslinger of Austria in the first round of the middleweight class. Despite his defeat he entered the heavyweight class and placed 2nd. This was the first legitimate international championship tournament in Catch-as-catch-can; wrestlers from eight countries competed, England, Scotland, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Japan","i am related to this man, he is my great great grandfarther, from what i have been told he was a very nasty man, he beat his children and every thing else.  luckily i dont have any of those tendencies.","I am proud to say Peter Gotz was my Great Grandfather!

It is only the folly of youth and inexperience of life that could lead someone to fail to understand the hardships and psycological damage caused by the hand that life dealt Peter!  he was a remarkable man far from home, persecuted for his country of origin, a widower left with 4 small children in the slums of London's East End.

According to German law, Schumann-Heink, by marrying a foreigner, had forfeited her property in Germany. Also, her boys were required to serve in the army before they could leave the country. The German courts decided the boys and daughter Marie could accompany her to America and that she could retain one-third of the money in Germany as she, rather than her deceased husband, had earned it.

After Johnson decisively beat James J. Jeffries--the former Champion who had retired undefeated but been lured back to fight Johnson-- on July 4, 1910, the term &quot;White Hope&quot; was coined. \n\nAs the March 1930 The Ring magazine stated:\n&quot;It was back in the period between 1910 and 1915 that every overgrown small town lad who thought he had any ability, was signed by big and small time managers, placed in the hands of trainers, with the dethroning of Jack Johnson as the chief objective. From the most unheard of places there came prospective heavyweight champions. They loomed on the fistic horizon from far off sections which were scarcely visible to the naked eye. \n\n&quot;Some came on and begged for a chance because they saw big money ahead. Others were sent along by big moneyed men who thrived on the publicity they were getting. Still others were grabbed up by good judges of fighters from the mines, the lumber camps and the farms. Most of them came quickly and hit the trail back home even quicker.&quot; \n\nSome of these White Hopes included: \n\nCarl Morris: considered the original &quot;White Hope.&quot; His hopes were crushed by a loss to Fireman Jim Flynn. \nLuther McCarty \nAl Palzer \nCharley Miller, the &quot;Fighting Motorman,&quot; whose chances were also quashed by a knockout loss to Fireman Jim Flynn. \nJess Willard--who, in fact, eventually did win the Title from Johnson \nSee also, The Great White Hopes: The Quest to Defeat Jack Johnson \n\nfrom &quot;http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/White_Hope&quot;","Great background info for this photo","This looks like the same location where the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2333657876/\">other photo of Al Palzer</a> posted a few weeks ago was taken.

Within weeks, Palzer's manager was promoting a match between Palzer and Jack Johnson, probably reasoning that, should Palzer defeat Johnson, the white fans would be so eager to recognize him as world champion that McCarty's ersatz title would be cast aside despite his New Year's Day victory. Though Johnson accepted the challenge, the bout never took place, and Palzer never won the heavyweight title.\n\nFrom The Times, January 18, 1913: <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00EFD7123BE633A2575BC1A9679C946296D6CF&amp;scp=50&amp;sq=Al+Palzer&amp;st=p\">JOHNSON AGREES TO BOX PALZER IN PARIS</a>.","Interesting stories!

On the other hand, he looks relatively hale and hearty in this photo.  \n\n4) Do the uniforms of the players and clothes of the fans look more like 1930 or 1912?\n\n5) An article from NYTimes published August 13, 1912 (but dated Aug 12) reads: Taft will see Nationals Play To-day.&quot;  <b>President Taft, Major D. L. Rhoads, his personal aid; Gen. Clarence R. Edwards, and W.C. Herron, the President's brother in law</b>, will occupy a box at American leage Park tomorrow, when the Washington team plays its first home game in several weeks and meets Chicago.

Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.","Attn.
