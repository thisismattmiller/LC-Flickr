Potter, prominent Casselton residents, he having within the last few days been given the rank of major. His promotion is from a captaincy and so far as can be learned here, makes him the youngest major in the entire United States service.\nAs major he now becomes a member of the general staff of the war department, and left California last Tuesday for Washington, D. C., in obedience to his new orders.\nMajor Potter, then a captaln with the Fifteenth Field artillery, was sent only two weeks ago from New York on special detail work to Presidio, Cal., and it was while at the latter place that he was notified of his promotion. Last year he was sent to Yale, and spent the winter helping train the students there in military tactics.&quot;\n\nMoretti, is probably Onorio Moretti, author of &quot;Notes on Training, Field Artillery Details,&quot; published in 1917 by Yale University Press.\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Notes_on_Training_Field_Artillery_Detail/IiouAAAAYAAJ?hl=en\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.google.com/books/edition/Notes_on_Training_Field_Arti...</a>\nThe title page says that Moretti wrote it under the supervision of Danford, and describes them as Asst. Professor and Professor of Military Science at Yale University, respectively, both having formerly been instructors at the School of Fire for Field Artillery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\n\nSo, if Bain and the newspaper reports are correct about the ranks, this picture might have been taken between June 1916 and October 1917 with the names written on the negative at the time.  Alternatively, it could have been taken earlier in their military careers, with the names on the negative written during that period.","Given that the next picture in the Bain stream has a neighboring negative number and is identified as at Yale, I suspect this is taken at Yale.  \n\nWaldo Potter was at Yale with Danford too.

A distinguished soldier, administrator and politician (his father was a Liberal Prime Minister), Lord Rosebery was a keen sportsman, and though he will be best remembered as perhaps the major figure of the British Turf in his lifetime, his relatively brief indulgence in county cricket was notable. He had scored 52 for Eton against Harrow in 1900, and at the age of 20 he hit a memorable 197 against MCC. He began playing occasionally for Surrey in 1904 after having played for Buckinghamshire in 1901, twice for Middlesex in 1902, and for Surrey against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in 1903.&quot;\n\nI wondered if this last detail means that he actually played cricket in the U.S. But the New-York Tribune.

Future impresario Sol Hurok organized extravagant Socialist parades and pageantry in Brooklyn; J.C.

April 6.—Sir Thomas Lipton's arrival in this country for the reported purpose of clearing the ground for a challenge for the America’s cup serves chiefly to remind yachting enthusiasts of the decay of the sport of racing and sailing big windjammers in this country.\nThere is a nautical strain in the American blood which will never be eliminated, and its effects are seen in the clouds of racing sailboats of the smaller classes that beautify the bays and rivers of the Atlantic Seaboard, the inland lakes of the Middle West and Pacific Coast waters.\nBut when it comes to the canvas-propelled leviathans which used to dominate the regattas of the New York Yacht Club there is a different story. With few exceptions the largest sloops now are of 40-foot water-line length, while schooners do not exceed 70 feet. And there are few enough of those.&quot;","Thomas Lipton did manage to get one more challenge accepted after 1926, but the next America's Cup was not until 1930.\n\nThe 1930 race and a few subsequent ones used J-class boats.\nSee <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Class_(yacht)\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Class_(yacht)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_V\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_V</a>\nThe boat built by Camper and Nicholson for Lipton for the 1930 race, was still in use and available for charter until very recently.\n\nHere she was in 2009:\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05/53579375444/in/dateposted-public/\" title=\"IMG_1629\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53579375444_92b6def138_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" alt=\"IMG_1629\" /></a>\n\nIn June 2023, she was having a refit.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/shamrock-v-yacht-restoration\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/shamrock-v-yacht-re...</a>","Thanks  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardarthurnorton] and [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05] , we'll update the catalog record.","Tito Schipa (1889-1965), Italian tenor \n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q456827\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q456827</a>","See earlier photos of Schipa in the Bain stream linked from:\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/51104822041/in/photolist-2kRXz8p-2kRXz41-2hGWwcp-2iqk3oU-YK7yTD-2hGWwuD-2hGWwkA-YK7xXk-YK7yDv-2jtW8tw-2igiAon-2kRXUgs-YK7ybX-2pCgn9o-2ighxf9-2maeHTm-2iLvyRs-2iLvyXV-2majW2J-2mafESg-2maindP-2maeHHg-2majVM5-2maeJ8z-2jtUJRP-2maeJ3p-2krfgzA-2kraYvE-2kreNAj\" title=\"Schipa (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51104822041_a511dc9188_n.jpg\" width=\"235\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Schipa (LOC)\" /></a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Schipa\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Schipa</a>\n&quot;Tito Schipa (Italian pronunciation: [ˈskiːpa]; born Raffaele Attilio Amedeo Schipa; 2 January 1889 in Lecce – 16 December 1965) was an Italian lyric tenor, considered the greatest tenore di grazia and one of the most popular tenors of the century.&quot;\n\nAn earlier picture with his wife is at:\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/50198949761/in/photolist-2jtUJRP-2mZrgor-kb1uxd-4vVACT-jmwrQg-2maeJ3p-2j75Cfu-2jtW84e-2krfgzA-27BvWB5-9RjRz5-FixkJF-2it4rec-CFtp3V-akdZ6d-bSfHUF-2hwYpCz-7vXhL6-QRVD6d-2kraYvE-2nVe76E-LLaiEf-L6zrJF-9DQXWJ-MdpFDY-8yZScx-6s18by-93Cfap-9sids1-wcY5gc-5Rjvgr-o4sBuM-2jjBPZ2-2jjyRZ7-9eFK5W-2kzRgEi-wcmf7J-253hAUw-vVxyBF-vfY9HY-aMibZV-vg5Wkr-vVnsqU-waHCjy-71erBQ-4N7xzo-wcYUe6-9mTKh9-wcjzfC-wcXPp8\" title=\"Schipa and wife, 1/15/25 (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50198949761_69744fff84_n.jpg\" width=\"224\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Schipa and wife, 1/15/25 (LOC)\" /></a>\nHis wife is Antoinette.

Lord Ashburton, whom Miss Belmont is to marry, Is a widower. His wife, a daughter of Viscount Hood, died a year ago last January. He Is the head of the famous London banking company of Baring.\nThe career of Miss Belmont reads like a fairy tale. She Is a New Yorker, though she was born In Ireland. Her first appearance on the stage was as one of the broom and mop girls In the chorus of &quot; Miladi.&quot;\n&quot; When Maggie Dolan scrubbed the floor\nYou can bet the floor was clean.&quot;\nMiss Belmont scrubbed as she sang In the chorus of twelve girls and she made such a hit that she soon had a chance to make an easier living by posing for art and fashion magazines. She found that there was more money and less work In allowing herself to be photographed than In the life of a chorus girl and she followed this for a little while until she, one day, reappeared on the stage in the Florodora sextet. At this time she was ambitious and asked for something better than the part of a &quot; Pretty Maiden.&quot; This did not fall In with the Idea of her managers, and she left &quot; Florodora.&quot;\n\nDetermination Wins High Place.\n\nHer next work was In the &quot;Toreador.&quot; She had a vaulting ambition, and in her Ideas of what part she would like to play, that of the leading woman In &quot;A Message from Mars &quot; took complete possession of her mind. One night Charles Hawtrey was In a box at the &quot; Toreador.&quot;\n&quot; Do you see that man over there?&quot; whispered Miss Belmont to the chorus girl next to her. &quot; That's Charles Hawtrey, the great English actor. I am going to get that man to give me a place In his company. You watch and see.&quot;\n\nThe next thing that happened was that the world of chorus girls, soubrettes, and managers was electrified to hear that Frances Belmont was engaged as the lending woman of Charles Hawtrey In &quot; A Message from Mars.&quot; How she met Mr. Hawtrey no one could learn. When asked as to how she got the engagement she answered;\n&quot; O, he just offered me the part and I accepted it.&quot;\n&quot; Had he ever seen you act?&quot;\n&quot; O, yes, I went down to a rehearsal and ran through a few roles for him one afternoon and he offered me the contract.&quot;\nManagers and every one who had seen Miss Belmont\njoined In the prediction that she would not &quot; make good.&quot;\n&quot; She has had no experience,&quot; said a well known manager.\n&quot; She can't even walk across the stage. I have a dozen girls In my chorus who could do as well as she can.&quot;\nThat this was all a matter of mere pique was seen when It resulted that Miss Belmont did make good. Now she has made good matrimonially also. Her home is in a little flat In New York with her mother and two sisters. They have even now gone across to be present at the wedding. Miss Belmont herself, however, who feels that her education has been deficient, is In a convent In Paris learning many things which will help to fit her for the high position which she will be called upon to fill.\n\n====","Thanks  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05], we'll add some of that info to the catalog record.","Bain did take a photo of her and Lord Ashburton together, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014719250/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014719250/</a>.","Francis Denzil Edward Baring, 5th Baron Ashburton (1866-1938)\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480720\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480720</a>\n\nFrances Donnelly (1885-1959), they married on 19 February 1906.\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q75355823\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q75355823</a>\n\nAs per above, Bain republished a 1906 image and filed it in with the 1926 tranche, instead of returning it to 1906.","Louis Lombard (1861-1927)\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61999453\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61999453</a>","See <a href=\"https://researchworks.oclc.org/archivegrid/collection/data/122613989\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">researchworks.oclc.org/archivegrid/collection/data/122613989</a> for the biography from his papers, held by the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University.\n\n&quot;Louis Lombard, a violinist, composer, and conductor who founded the Utica Conservatory of Music, was born in Lyon, France, in 1861. In 1870, Lombard's parents moved to Marseille, where he began taking classes in violin, solfeggio, and harmony of the National Conservatory of Music. In 1876 he visited the United States on a concert tour, returning to Paris in 1878 to continue his studies. He returned to the U.S. in 1879, traveling as a violin soloist and conductor. In 1886, H.C. Bunner, editor of Puck, wrote the libretto of a comic opera, to which Louis Lombard composed the music. In 1887 he again went abroad, traveling through seventeen countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. During this time, he studied eight languages and began to compose and conduct music. Upon his return to the United States in 1888, Lombard began his studies at the Columbia Law School. In February 1889, having proposed opening a conservatory of music in Utica, New York, he secured a large financial guarantee from 100 prominent families. He then gave up the study of law, and on September 2, 1889, opened the Utica Conservatory of Music with six professors and 186 students. Lombard's works have been published by C. Berdan, Oliver Ditson, Theodore Presser, and E.D. Buckingham. In 1900 he purchased a property in Switzerland where he kept an orchestra in residence, inviting prominent musicians to perform there. He conducted his personal orchestra as well as orchestras in New York, Paris, Milan, Berlin, Budapest, and Cairo. While living in Switzerland, he also composed and self-published music for orchestras, military bands, string quartets, and piano. From 1916 to 1920 he served as American Vice-Consul in both Zurich and Lugano. He died in 1927.&quot;\n\nAlso at <a href=\"https://aspace.library.jhu.edu/repositories/4/resources/1189\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">aspace.library.jhu.edu/repositories/4/resources/1189</a>","In April 1926, Lombard was in the news.

The fact that he is not wearing either the British War Medal or the Allied Victory Medal, both instituted in 1919, suggests some time between 1917 and 1919 for the date.","Thanks for the information  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/henrycrun]. I tried to determine a more accurate date for this image, but it's hard because we don't have dates for any of the negatives before or after it. For the most part their negatives are mostly chronological. Occasionally they seemed to hold one back so two photos of the same event may not be together, but it will be nearby.  In Harris &amp; Ewing's numbering scheme this is A-266. Some of the photos like A-174 and A-197 show King Albert when he visited Washington on October 29th, 1919. That means that A-266 is probably late 1919, possibly early 1920.","How's this? A-240 through maybe A-259 appear to show scenes related to Prince Edward's visit to the US in November of 1919.

According to a New York Post article from Nov. 8, 2000, Nautica had acquired the space and planned to open their store in April of 2001. So that cuts it down to 2000-2006, but there's no Christmas Tree (and there definitely was one that year, I checked), so that pushes it to 2001. I will change the date range on this photo to 2001-2006.","He's wearing a sac jacket and has a celluloid collar; but that doesn't necessarily push it back as far as 1873. The photo also significantly freezes motion, particularly the background skater, and a decent shutter would have been necessary to achieve this. Reliable, commercially available shutters really only date to the mid-1880s, and my guess about this photo is that a date between 1890 and 1910 is far more likely.","Thanks [https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonemacduff].

In 1932, Machine Gun Kelley robbed a bank in Tupelo. Out of fear of a robbery in Columbus, Capt Sam Kaye was asked to loan a German machine gun he had brought home after WWI to the bank. It was placed on the bank’s\nmezzanine pointing down aimed at the front entrance. The bank hired WWI veteran, John Perry, to stand guard with the gun.\nLater the gun was returned to Kaye but Perry remained as a bank guard armed with a shotgun. The structure continued to serve as the main office until 1972 when growth of banking operations forced its relocation to a larger facility. In 1981, as a gesture of community goodwill and to honor an exceptional employee, the\nMerchants and Farmers Bank gave the building to the City of Columbus through the Columbus Civic Arts Council to be used as a Visual Arts Museum. When the Museum was relocated to Mississippi University for Women, the City returned the ownership.&quot;","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_State_Bank_(Georgetown,_Texas)\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_State_Bank_(Georgetown,_Texas)</a>\n716 South Austin Avenue, Georgetown, Texas\nNow the Williamson Museum.\n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/tvr6pmc18aabxmWz6\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">2022 Streetview</a>","214 W 3rd St\n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/CZvgbkNAxr6orCJx5\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">2019 Streetview</a>\nThe Riverfront Hotel\nRiver Rose Suites","See <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/53061734893/in/feed-8602872-1689949659-1-72157721679368159/\" title=\"Yankton National Bank, Keley's Bar, front, car at right, Third Street, Yankton, South Dakota (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53061734893_f9a2454e87_n.jpg\" width=\"224\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Yankton National Bank, Keley's Bar, front, car at right, Third Street, Yankton, South Dakota (LOC)\" /></a>","121 Main, Ellendale, North Dakota 58436\nNow home to Dickey County Abstract &amp; Title\nSee <a href=\"https://pocketsights.com/tours/place/121-Main-Baldwin-Building-Dickey-County-Abstract-Title-7385:1287\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">pocketsights.com/tours/place/121-Main-Baldwin-Building-Di...</a>\n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/KqPBEmQyWGnvEQGV7\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">2022 Streetview</a>","See <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/53061732938/in/feed-8602872-1689949659-1-72157721679368159/\" title=\"Southeast Bank (1897) Duval and Front Streets, Key West, Florida (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53061732938_9e67352b0f_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"216\" alt=\"Southeast Bank (1897) Duval and Front Streets, Key West, Florida (LOC)\" /></a>","See <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/53061732938/in/feed-8602872-1689949659-1-72157721679368159/\" title=\"Southeast Bank (1897) Duval and Front Streets, Key West, Florida (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53061732938_9e67352b0f_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"216\" alt=\"Southeast Bank (1897) Duval and Front Streets, Key West, Florida (LOC)\" /></a>","<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/MC31nr59s7uSkqZE6\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">2019 Streetview</a>\nAddress looks to be 420 Front St, Key West, FL 33040","1099 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90024\nIt has lost the unusual Bank of America sign.\n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Ag3ed4MfLcNTe3Q9A\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">2021 Streetview</a>\nIn 2023 it is the Broxton Brewery &amp; Public House.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Westwood.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Westwood.html</a> the building was known as the Janss Dome, completed in 1930 to house the headquarters of the Janss Investment Company, which built Westwood Village.\nIn 1988, the Janss Investment Company Building (Janss Dome) was dedicated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 364.

Between tracks Nos. 3 and 4 six athletic young men on a Stearns sextuplet were kicking the pedals for all they were worth. Arrangements for the race were quietly completed several days ago. At this point is a stretch of cinder path about four feet wide and a mile and a half long. As soon as the Empire hove in sight, after leaving here, the sextuplet got under way. The Empire was soon abreast and the race began. For a quarter of a mile it was an even thing. At the end of a half mile the sex-tuplet was four lengths ahead. The sex-tuplet was then obliged to slow down, owing to a short bridge a quarter of a mile ahead. A number of railroad officers and bicycle men witnessed the race. Arthur Yates, official photographer of the New York Central, took four photographs of the race.&quot;","Not &quot;the Stearns sextuplets&quot;, but &quot;the Stearns Sextuplet&quot;.

David Danziger. \n\nIn Summer 1925 the Vincent Lopez orchestra left from New York on the <i>Leviathan</i> for a 2 month gig in London playing at the Piccadilly Hotel and the Kit-Kat Club. Their departure from NYC reads like a slapstick movie scene\n\n<blockquote> Lopez was tipped off in advance that some of his creditors might be intending to seize the band instruments. These were therefore hastily re-packed into crates labelled “Gear Machinery”, “China -Handle With Care” and “Typewriters -This Side Up”! Lopez himself boarded the ship at 5.OOam on the morning of departure, and took good care not to emerge from Billy Hamilton’s cabin and take up his own until the three mile limit had been passed.</blockquote>\n\nThe band's violinist for this trip was not Danziger but none other than Xavier Cugat.  Danziger was on the SS Paris with the others on their return from London.  Danziger had his own show on WJZ for a while and they certainly knew each other.","The Lopez Orchestra trip to England is described at:\n<a href=\"http://www.mgthomas.co.uk/dancebands/american visitors/pages/vincent lopez.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.mgthomas.co.uk/dancebands/american%20visitors/pages/v...</a>\nwhich says, &quot;The band and Lopez left New York on 1st.

Wollam (1893-1960[?]), photographed after (given the &quot;6/25/25&quot; date inscription) their adventurous participation the 1925 Gordon Bennett Trophy Race.\n\nAs per Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Van_Orman\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Van_Orman</a>\n<blockquote>During the 1925 International Race Van Orman performed world's first emergency night landing of a balloon on a deck of a steamship at high seas. The race took off June 9, 1925 at Brussels; at first the <i>Goodyear III</i> balloon floated over France towards Spain but then a change in wind dragged it into Atlantic Ocean. Van Orman's partner, Carl Wollam, desperate about inevitable death by drowning, intoxicated himself with cognac and attempted suicide at least twice. As Van Orman struggled to restrain Wollam from jumping overboard, he noticed navigation lights of a ship that turned out to be a small German freighter, <i>Vaterland</i>. Van Orman flashed morse code messages to the captain, who assisted the landing by turning on all available lighting and steering the ship towards the descending balloon. The balloon safely landed on <i>Vaterland's</i> forward deck. Van Orman and captain Rudolf Norman remained friends for life. This flight was the longest in the 1925 International Race, but Van Orman was disqualified and denied the Gordon Bennett Trophy according to the race rules requiring landing to be on land. Fifty years after this event, Van Orman was still bitterly hurt by the disqualification: &quot;the memory of that unfair decision never has grown dim&quot;.</blockquote>\nThis would be far from the last of Van Orman's aviation adventures and achievements in a remarkably lived life.","The Evening Star.

It is the largest memorial in the United States dedicated solely to honoring all branches of military veterans and service personnel.\n\nIt was conceived by the Grand Army of the Republic in the 1890s as a way for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County to honor the dwindling ranks of its American Civil War veterans; it was built on what had served as the army mustering ground during the Civil War. The Memorial today represents all branches of the service and honors both career and citizen soldiers who have served the United States throughout its history.\n\nArchitect Henry Hornbostel designed the memorial in 1907.

City Postmaster Chance declared today that if the &quot;Xmas post office,&quot; as it will be called, proves a success. probably it will be retained as a permanent &quot;office on wheels.&quot;\n     * Office Described * \nThree clerks will be stationed in the &quot;office,&quot; which will occupy a space about 6 by 8 feet in the front of the truck. There will be a counter, and a &quot;lobby&quot; for patrons. Entrance will be from the rear of the truck, up a flights of steps, through a door on the right. Exit will be by a door on the left.\n&quot;Everything except chairs&quot; will be provided for the convenience of patrons. There will be electric lights and heat and full facilities for mailing parcels.\n\n    * Will Be at War Risk Bureau. * \nIt Is probable that the &quot;Xmas post office&quot; will be stationed In front of the war risk insurance bureau on its first trip, which probably will be made Saturday morning. Present plans call for the stationing of the truck at various busy corners, the schedule to\nbe announced later.\nWhen the ambulating post office Is filled with parcels. It will &quot;up anchor&quot; and swiftly proceed to the city post office, and then run downtown again.\nShould a great rush be made upon it, this plan will be abandoned, and mail will be taken from it hourly as the\noffice fills up.\nFive easy steps will give easy access to the &quot;lobby&quot; of the post office on wheels.\n===&gt;","Could be  <a href=\"https://peoplelegacy.com/jerome_hill-2m4C791\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">peoplelegacy.com/jerome_hill-2m4C791</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/155084978/jerome-hill\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/memorial/155084978/jerome-hill</a>","See the sheet music pages at <a href=\"https://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/collection/103/001\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/collection/103/001</a>","See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-mail\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-mail</a>\n&quot;V-mail, short for Victory Mail, was a hybrid mail process used by the United States during the Second World War as the primary and secure method to correspond with soldiers stationed abroad.

Knitting needles and embroidery hoops are being discarded for the metal slate and stylus with which Braille books are hand\nwritten. Clubs and Red Cross chapters are busily punching out stories and articles in the code of dotswhich is the blind man's closest connecting link with written thought.\n  There is always a need for books for the blind. The big cities have their Braille libraries, but the selection of books on the shelves is always limited. The novel you buy for a dollar or two and tuck in your overcoat pocket would cost $20 in Braille and would fill three or more large tomes.\n  Libraries for the blind are slowly growing all the time, but since the war blind have been added to the number to be provided with Braille reading matter, the Red Cross decided that extra effort was needed.\n  For three years six chapters of the Red Cross have been making\nBraille books. Last fall the National Red Cross arranged to make this work a part of the national program. Courses in Braille writing\nwere prepared by Mrs. Gertrude T. Rider, librarian of the Room for the Blind in the Library of Congress. Certificates were prepared for those who should master the system in order to make books for the soldiers.\n  Miss Adelia Hoyt of the Reading Room for the Blind says that for\nthe present all books made by the volunteers will go to Evergreen, the institute established by the Red Cross at Baltimore for training blinded soldiers and sailors. Later, it is planned to send books to big circulating libraries for civilian\nblind.&quot;\n\nThe article describes several ways in which Braille can be produced, including typewriters. \n&quot;The Braille typewriter is another of the three means of making books for the blind. The typewriter has only six keys, one for each dot that may be used in a letter. To make a letter, the proper keys are struck simultaneously, like a c[h]ord. The typewriter is a more speedy instrument than the slate, but it is considerably more expensive, costing about $32.&quot;","See also\n * <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/11/13/113322864.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/11/13/11332286...</a>\n * <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1925/08/02/99352292.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1925/08/02/99352292...</a>\n * <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1924/04/13/101590172.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1924/04/13/10159017...</a>\n  This article states that &quot;Nearly fifty Red Cross workers are continually at work producing Braille books for the blinded veterans, and all years classes are conducted at the Red Cross Teaching Centre at 24 Fifth Avenue.&quot;","This would be Wendy Vanderbilt Lehman (1939-2016)\nSee <a href=\"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/181261291/wendy-maria-lehman\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/memorial/181261291/wendy-maria-lehman</a>\n\nShe doesn't have a Wikipedia entry, but her father is\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gwynne_Vanderbilt_Jr\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gwynne_Vanderbilt_Jr</a>.\nand that provides some biographical details.\n\nThe house is\n  <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/vama/learn/historyculture/the-mansion.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.nps.gov/vama/learn/historyculture/the-mansion.htm</a>\n\nLocated on Albany Post Road, Dutchess County, NY at\n<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/DEH2uc4QioSxZiG78\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">goo.gl/maps/DEH2uc4QioSxZiG78</a>","I've been to that place many, many times.","Courcheval ? are you this is not Courchevel instead, a ski resort in France ?","Thanks [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196203353@N06] for spotting that spelling error.

At 19, he was taller than his accompanist, the six-foot-plus Richard Hageman. Subsequently he appeared in New York at Aeolian Hall, where he performed “as a sensitive and able musician” and in a number of recitals in private homes and for charity.

These courses are somewhat beyond the writer’s ability at description. However I will comment on two holes that deserve comment.\n\nOne hole involves a small church through which one must play. Don’t be distracted by the quotation above the door – “I am happy to enter the house of the Lord” – or the 6-foot rabbit nearby. Concentration is the point here. A second hole involves a ramp that leads to the belly of a kangaroo. If you are fortunate your shot will enter the plastic pouch, and then emerge from the animal’s tail. Not anatomically correct, but an automatic hole-in-one.&quot;\n\nThe quotation above this church door is actually &quot;I was Glad when they said unto me.  Let us go into the House of the LORD.&quot;\n\nAnother mention of Wacky Golf is at\n<a href=\"http://www.gethep.net/golf/gg.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.gethep.net/golf/gg.html</a>\n\n&quot;Other Goofy Golf style courses soon began to appear throughout the southern United States.

The Gibson Girl represented the visual ideal of this new phenomenon.\n\nThis poster advertising for a June issue of Scribner's Magazine shows the Gibson Girl's ability to enjoy strenuous physical activities. Through depictions of young women bicycling, playing tennis and golf, horseback riding, and swimming, artist Charles Dana Gibson and fellow illustrators helped promote the idea of the athletic girl as fashionable and socially acceptable.","Gibson was a major influence on my father. My dad graduated high school in '41, and after he got out of the Navy made his living for the rest of his life as what then was called a 'commercial' artist. Many of my dad's illustrations resembled Gibson's style, a style which remained popular in advertising for a great long time.\nI've found sketchbooks that my dad had filled while in high school and I can see the Gibson influence.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/johngpt] You should scan them and put them on Flickr or at least make them digital to preserve them.

I'm sure she'd be amenable.","For African American Music Month (June), we turn to R. Nathaniel Dett (1882-1943), a choral and piano composer inspired by African American folk songs and spirituals. In 1913, Dett began a career at the Hampton Institute and became its first Black director of music in 1926.\n\nDett performed at Carnegie Hall and the Boston Symphony Hall and was later a choral advisor in the United Service Organization (USO) during World War II.","&quot;How may I direct your call?&quot;\n\nAt the time of this 1950s view, the Capitol Switchboard handled an average of 50,000 calls each day with 75 operators answering. The Capitol Switchboard operators handled calls to both the Senate and the House.","I love how they have a place on their stools to put their purses.

This cord suggests they are &quot;service observing,&quot; or eavesdropping on one of their operators.

She was particularly noted for her singing of the music of Richard Wagner, in roles such as Ortrud (Lohengrin), Venus (Tannhäuser), Erda (Das Rheingold and Siegfried), Brangäne (Tristan und Isolde), and Brunnhilde (Die Walküre).\n...\nShe first appeared at the Metropolitan Opera on 6 February 1924, singing Fricka in Die Walküre, and sang there every season until 1944.

Hooven Griffis, who arrived here on the American liner Albert Ballln yesterday. Griffis recently was released from a German prison, to which he was sentenced after an unsuccessful attempt to bring Grover Cleveland Bergdoll to America for trial as a draft evader.\nThe city’s official welcoming tug, the Macom, went down the bay to meet the Ballin and take Griffis to the Battery, whence he was to have been transported to the city hall to be greeted by Acting Mayor Collins and given the freedom of the metropolis.\n\nMisunderstanding Balks Plans.\n\nDue, however, to a misunderstanding, Griffis did not get aboard the Macom.

With John Campbell of Great Britain, the second member of the commission, Mr. Morgenthau made a brief survey of refugee conditions in Saloniki and adjacent territories, after which the two commissioners proceeded to Athens to confer with the government and start drafting plans for the agricultural settlements which the league has authorised in its loan of 325,000,000 to Greece.\nAt the present time hundreds of thousands of refugees are crowded into Saloniki, Macedonia and western Thrace, dependent upon government doles and what feeding- can be given by British and American relief organizations. The immediate purpose of the commission is to establish the agriculturalists among them upon the untilled lands of Macedonia and western Thrace.

Macready. Not only was Macready distinguished as an aviator and test pilot, he's also considered by many to be the father of Aviator-style sunglasses.\nSee: \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/magazine/who-made-those-aviator-sunglasses.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/magazine/who-made-those-aviato...</a>\n<blockquote><b>Who Made Those Aviator Sunglasses?</b>\n\nBy Pagan Kennedy\nNew York Times Magazine (Page 20) - Aug. 5, 2012 \n\nEarly in the 20th century, as test pilots began flying higher than Mount Everest, they had to defend themselves against temperatures as low as minus-80 degrees Fahrenheit. To survive the frigid blast, aviators wore leather hoods, and they insulated their eyes with fur-lined goggles. To lift those goggles for even an instant was to risk death. In 1920, when Shorty Schroeder dared to take a biplane above 33,000 feet, his goggles fogged and he had no choice but to pull them off. Moments later, his vision blurred, and his eyes were soon frozen over.\n\nSchroeder managed to land the plane that day, and his friend John Macready helped pull him out of the cockpit. A month later, still haunted by the memory of his friend’s swollen eyelids, Macready climbed into the same plane to beat Schroeder’s altitude record. Like Schroeder, Macready depended on goggles that had been designed to seal his eyes from the cold and protect his sight. But the early goggles were not dark enough, and “the bright sunlight in the upper atmosphere hurt his eyes,” said his daughter, Sally Macready Wallace.\n\nAnd so Macready began working with Bausch &amp; Lomb to design goggles especially suited to protect against the dazzle in the stratosphere. “My dad gave Bausch &amp; Lomb the original shape, tint and fit” of aviator lenses, Wallace said.\n\nBy the late 1930s, advertisements for Bausch &amp; Lomb’s Ray Ban sunglasses promised “real scientific glare protection” for fishermen and golfers. Not yet called aviators, the glasses nonetheless captured the essence of aviator goggles, with their teardrop shape and frames as delicate as a biplane’s struts. Sold as sporting equipment, they cost several dollars at a time when sunglasses could be had for 25 cents. During World War II, aviators became standard gear for military men, including Gen. Douglas MacArthur. . . </blockquote>","Thanks for the link to additional info  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/danuneken] and for the interesting story about aviator sunglasses  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/25695066@N00].","Thank you for your post in :\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/portrait_face/\">Portrait★Faces</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Landowska\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Landowska</a>","According to the Evening Star.

It looks better than just &quot;thrown together&quot; - was there an anti-Japanese sentiment prior to Pearl Harbor that would have provoked the making and hanging of such a sign?","Fritz Rambo and Pablo Fonzirelli Chihuahuas: That's an intriguing question. Perhaps it's possible that a professional sign painter could do that in a day, or maybe they originally put up a more temporary sign the day after Pearl Harbor and then had a better one made that was in the photograph taken in March?","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/fonziandfritz] All the signage  you see, the writing in the window, the boards for the shops, all done by hand.

In other words, if you had the money to pay for it, a sign like this could be knocked out in a few hours, and put up in 30-40 minutes, so yes, it's entirely possible. If that particular sign-painting company was owned by a Japanese-American, I would bet that they would be even more likely to put a rush on the order. As for anti-Asian sentiment, it was endemic to the culture of the time, so it's unlikely there was any previous specific precipitating incident, but it's always possible that there may have been.","<i>As a result of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese of\nMountain View </i>[California]<i> were intimidated because of\nMoffett Field’s location, (a military installation).

It often was made of walnut or beech.\n\nAt first it was cut by hand, then after 1660 with the help of a lathe.\n\nThe twisted leg went out of style in the second half of the 18th century, when curved legs came into fashion.

She married Albert George Thomas in New Orleans on 30 October 1907. A mezzo-soprano, this Edna developed a large repertoire of ‘creole negro songs’ and ‘spirituals’. As she explained: ‘It was from my black mammy, Ninna, who reared me, that I first learned the negro spirituals. “Sperrituals” she calls them. She has been in our family so long that she insists that her name is Dare, same as my grandmother's, “Forginny Davis Dare is my name,” she says. From London last year I sent her a letter addressed “Miss Virginia Davis Dare, alias Ninna”, and she was mighty offended. “Oh, Mis’ Ella,” she said to my mother, “that alias is no good. Only criminals have dem aliases.”’\n\nSuccessful forays to Great Britain in 1923 and 1924 culminated in a reported 12-week season at the London Coliseum. This was followed by her first Australian visit.'\n\nSo this could be sailing to or from Great Britain in 1923.","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Claypoole_Vanderbilt\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Claypoole_Vanderbilt</a>","With his second wife, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt (1904-1965) married March 6, 1923).
