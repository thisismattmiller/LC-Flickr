To me it looks liek Dorthea Lange IF she had used color.","A mi también me gusta....","cool haa...........","taellinuaichi: The photographer for this image was Alfred T. Palmer.  He worked for the Office of War Information News Bureau.  Interestingly, in a 1990 interview, Palmer was actually somewhat critical of some of the Depression-era photographs produced by the Farm Security Administration (FSA).  Speaking of Roy Stryker, who had headed the FSA unit for which Dorothea Lange worked and who later moved over to head an OWI photo unit, Palmer said, “He [Stryker] considered me a ‘glamour photographer’ who had to be taught the facts of life, but I felt that what he did at the FSA was manipulation—encouraging the photographers to show the worst conditions.  I didn’t carry a skull on the back of my car to plant in the foreground of a picture to make a point. I didn’t light a sharecropper’s shack in such a way as to make it look as stark as possible. I believed in looking at the things in a helpful and encouraging manner.” (quoted in Nicholas Natanson, <i>The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1992), 257-258. )\n\nPalmer also did maritime photography - a listing for materials by him appears here: <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf4j49n761&amp;doc.view=items&amp;item.position=101&amp;brand=oac\" rel=\"nofollow\">\nhttp://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf4j49n761&amp;doc.view=items&amp;item.position=101&amp;brand=oac</a>. He apparently shot motion pictures, as well.  There is a listing for a collection of his film work on this page:  <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/archive/safr/local/safrhdd.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nps.gov/archive/safr/local/safrhdd.html</a>.","Just excellent!","Ahh, Kodachrome ASA/ISO 10 (or could be 8), 4x5 (that's inches), magnesium flashbulb fill, can't get any better for pre-war\\wartime color.   Jack Delano was my fav from this time/medium (primarily for subject matter) but Palmer's up there as well.","Un trabajo excelente. Un 10 :D la luz del fondo es genial y la tonalidad de colores expectacular :D","Great photo's excellent !!!","excellent!   Art manifests.","A spectacular image, just goes to show the process of photography was essentally perfected by this time. The tools of the trade were a bit more tempermental but in the hand of the right professional they could yield an image as good or perhaps even better that we can today. My father shot alot of Kodak transparency film using his old Canon back in the 60's and the quality is beyond compare. Every time I look at them it amazes me, they could have been taken yesterday. In the digital age it easy to forget the chemical process and the beautiful images recorded for over  the last 150 years, I just dont think digital cameras are capable of this life like realism, at least not yet.","very nice shot!","nice","Fun interaction and the photo speaks for itself.","Nice shot","Amazing seeing these kind of shots, taken with a flash, so long ago.

I'd say help yourself.","the original m3 was changed by the british who removed the copula on top of the turret and enlarged the turret to take a radio.the british called these the grant.they later took delivery of the original version calling it the lee.the m3 in the picture have their copula so must asume to be lees.","Look carefully at the tank hulls. The first and third M3's have a more angular riveted hull than the second one which MIGHT be cast.  I've never seen one like the second one, but I do know that the Grant and Lee names (from the British) were due to production models.  The whole M3 medium series were an interim design that was rushed into production just to get something into the hands of the troops.\n\nThe first and second M4's also have a more angular hull of welded plates than the third one which has a rounded cast hull.   These were production variations from different plants, but all M4's were named Shermans.  It was the British who originally started the practice of naming US tanks after our generals.  Then we continued the practice with Pershing, Patton, Sheridan, and Abrams.","You're right. By the way I was on the &quot;Sheridan&quot;!","the cast hull version has the designation m3a1.and was built by the firm baldwin and lima.i might be wrong but i don,t think they originally made tanks but were an engineering firm.","just checked on baldwin and lima they make engine locamotives,maybe everyone in america knows this.not well known in scotland.","Maybe related-The only US tank plant is in Lima, Ohio.","Tank Porn!!","I do indeed like the great mmixture of different models, but Nevada Tumbleweed is correct, the &quot;General Grant&quot;, was the British lend-lease model.","The guy on the left must have been driving the lead tank -- he's sunburned, but clean.  (Maybe he had time to wash up before getting his photo taken.)","This looks like it was taken yesterday! Unbelievable quality.","Either this tank has super sticky treads, or the photo needs to be rotated... :-)","That's some damn fine American engineering that makes a tank that can do that!","spider tank, spider tank, does wahtever a spider tank does","A Tank On The Rocks !!!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/7/buddyicons/25965014@N00.jpg?1114184516\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" /> hahahaaha","rotate this photo please","Thanks all--it does look as though this tank is defying the laws of gravity.

Flickr 20 Year Gallery.","The title should be updated to remove the word &quot;colored.&quot;","Of course you shouldn't tamper with the old picture descriptions! This is a document of that era! The world has rapidly deteriorated since &quot;Politically Correctness&quot; showed its ugly face!","In the segregated US Army of 1942, this man was labeled 'colored'. To sugest removing that, is to suggest falsifying the history of blacks in the US.","you got served, foo.","Colored...................with LIGHT!!!!","The title is fine leave it alone. I'm Black, I'm not offended. Why would you want to sugar coat the past. What was sad during WW2 was that German POWs in some cases were treated better then Black American GIs.  The following picture got more heat then the Colored mechanic.......  Negro boy near Cincinnati, Ohio (LOC)\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/]","I don't get that. 'Negro' isn't a bad word, is it? Dr. King used it. It's old-fashioned, but i don't see it as a slur at all.","Edge of Europe, err not sure where you are coming from? Were you around when people used that word &amp; are used to it &amp; deem it ok?\nWell anyway, it was a word given to slaves by there masters, so even you can figure out how it's demeaning and seen as offensive.\nAnd besides to be totally honest, if your not even black your really not in a place to judge if it's offensive or not to you... obviously becuase your not the one it's directed at, &amp; can't make that call.","I am, in the words of many a rapper and comedian, a <i>cracker</i>. Even though I was born in Europe in 1969, far away from any plantation, and from a family of humble workmen instead of world travelling slave traders and plantation owners, some choose to give me a name born from the cracking of a whip.\n\nUntil such time when all those people who object to every single word used to describe their ethnic background start writing letters to Snoop Dogg and Chris Rock and the rest about the use of the word cracker, frankly I couldn't care less about someone objecting to a word used by the great Dr. King himself in one of his most famous speeches. \n\nYa dig?","É sempre bom ser reconhecido pelo serviço executado e fazer funcionar o que está parado.","Nice.\n\nHi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1239139@N20/\">People love their Work</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","So, black people can call each other &quot;nigg***&quot; all day long and its okay right? Give me a break.","I have a whole new appreciation for the lighting techniques of the 40s. This is wonderful","Beautiful shot.","I love the lighting in this entire set.  The techniques used are far more creative and advanced than what I would have expected from this era.","Brilliant","The greatest generation.","The greatest generation indeed, a shame they risked everything for the worst generation that followed.","Guys! Where you? We fight with enemies whole year, but your help everything isn't present...","looks like a young Frank Sinatra ! !","I agree, cardwellpics! But if you look at the larger size, he looks more like Steve McQueen.","M3 &quot;Stuart&quot; Light Tank","The quality of theese shots is great. Could be mistaken for contemporary shots (set aside the technology).","Fredo, a film transparency is equivalent to about 5,000 lpi resolution. It's more like today's digital technology is catching up with the old quality.","Right. But I was not commenting on the image resolution. Besides, on a image resolution this small (500x400) such a source resolution is pointless. My purpose was rather to comment image quality such as color balance, hue and definition, which in my opinion is quite remarkable for an exposure taken in the 1940's. In refering to the &quot;technology&quot;, I was refering to the tanks... \n\nRegards.","Hi Alfred, a great shot! I like it very much! Maybe you would like to post some of your pictures on <a href=\"http://www.military-vehicle-photos.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.military-vehicle-photos.com</a> I think the visitors over there would like that very much. Regards, Alf , The Netherlands.","Looks like there are more M-3's (Lee/Grant) than M-4's (Sherman) in that line.","The Sherman tank was also jokingly referred to as the Ronson. As in the cigarette lighter that &quot;lights on the first strike&quot;. Their ammo storage wasn't so well protected.","What a great picture. Being a history fanatic, I can't help but wonder if the reaction from the populous back then regarding the switch from the M-3's to the M-4's would be comparable to today's F-22's and F-35's.\n\nCould you imagine trying to aim the whole tank instead of just the turret?","There are also some M3 Stuart light tanks in the background","In the mood of the day, the government was lying to the public, telling everyone that our M3s and M4s were the best tanks in the world. By the time they got into action they were ridiculously obsolete. Incredibly reliable, but garbage. Men died by the thousands in 43, 44 and early 45 because of that. It wasn't until the M26 was fielded in early 1945 that our tankers had a vehicle that could go toe to toe with the stuff the enemy had been using for years.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/644480@N23/\">Shoot To Thrill!</a>, and we'd love to have your photo added to the group.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/345573@N24/\">Mal's Best of the Best</a>, and we'd love to have your photo added to the group.","I was very often thinking why I have different feeling from these very old photographs.. They usually have very low depth of field, which is understandable, but they also have amazing space.. I realized it when I was looking to the Library of Congress sets.. Almost all pictures have slightly shorter focus (closer to the camera). Notice that the focus is to the grass before tank, and not to the tank itself. Today's practice is to focus directly to the point of interest (eyes in the portrait photography, tank turret in this case..)","Just thinking of the military aspect.\n\nHow succesful was this tank on the battlefield?","Simply beautiful\nMAURICIO","is look very good","General Grant Tank..Used extensively in North Africa by both the US &amp; the Brits..Early WWII tank replaced by the Sherman.Check

The helmet is a British design (Brodie helmet) that was adopted by US forces in 1917 during World War One. The US designated it the M1917 helmet.","The good reliable M1 .30 cal. Garand rifle. It was the replacement for the bolt-action Springfield 1903 model. Both, sturdy rifles were good for close combat and fixed-bayonet fighting.","Yes, tomfs, on closer inspection it doesn't have the fluted barrel sleeve and that stubby muzzle-brake like the vickers.\nI didn't know about the M1917, so that is a new one. I think  the British design was loosly based on a medieval foot soldier's helmet.","wonderful works","Just an unuseul shot !!","the used flashbulb in the frame - accidental, or wry commentary on the inauthenticity of govt funded wartime documentary work?","Accidental.  There were many combat photographers during this time.  People were smart enough to know what is staged and what is not most of the time.  There is plenty of authentic government funded war time documentary work.   More like photographer was not paying attention.","this is a great shot, but one thing that stics out to me is.. the helmet does not macth up with the M1 Garand. If he was holding a garand he would have a later style helmet, maybe its just cause im a world war 2 nerd haha","Great shot!.","pero ..¿qué podían hacer con ese  casco que parece que se cae por todos los lados?","the lightbulb and not too interesting crop seems more more like a test frame before taking the actual photograph. the photographer later on probably felt that the photo was worth keeping around.","The combination of the Garand and the dishpan helmet puts this photo in 1940 (unlikely), 1941 (most likely) or 1942 (unlikely).  The Garand debuted in the late 1930s and some Army infantry regiments were fully equipped with it by 1940.  The M1 Helmet, on the other hand, did not enter service until 1941.  Photos show some Army units embarking for overseas (Iceland?) with the old dishpans.","These are amazing, seeing color from 1940 come to life...surreal","<b>My gosh</b> He must have been using that <a href=\"http://www.linkmuseum.org/collection.html\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.

Boxcars being used to haul grain. Rolling stock from (now) long gone railroads.","How sweet it is!","This EMD FT of Santa Fe's 100 class were the very first batch of road freight diesels delivered in 1941.  AT&amp;SF would eventually get 80 four unit sets of these first generation diesels and run them into the early to mid-1960's.  During WWII these locos were used mainly from Winslow AZ to points west in order to reduce water consumption in the desert.  They finished up their service in the less demanding Texas Gulf Coast where my grandfather was a Roadmaster in those days.  Childhood memories!  \n\nNotice the cream yellow color of what is now known as the &quot;catwhisker&quot; paint scheme.  In the mid-1950's theis paint scheme was replaced by the &quot;cigar band&quot; scheme which had a darker chrome yellow.  The Santa Fe really maintained their engines well including keeping them clean.","#103 shown here was part of the first four sets of FT engines that ATSF purchased from EMD (General Motors) in January 1941. Units #100-104 each consisted of a cab lead engine, two cabless boosters and a trailing cab unit (an &quot;LABC&quot; configuration). A total of 320 FT units were acquired by August 1945. These were used primarily in CA and AZ resulting in total dieselization of &quot;through&quot; freight trains (Winslow, San Bernardino, Bakersfield) when this great photo was taken.\n\nAfter the war, the #103 set was moved to the Argentine-Corwith freight pool on the Illinois-Missouri division of the ATSF (KC-Chicago). #103 lasted until 1960-61 when it was traded back to EMD for a new road switcher.\n\nThe early nose paint scheme shown here only existed on the #100-104 units. The red striping and SF shield were replaced by the classis yellow &quot;cigar-band&quot; used on all later blue FT/F3/F7 and ATSF passenger engines.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.shorpy.com/node/1747\">www.shorpy.com/node/1747</a>","I do not recall these colors on the Santa Fe.

Her blood line came out of England. She was white with red hair. She lived in Texas. She was my first African American girlfriend. Later I dated a very beautiful girl from Africa who lived in Mississippi. Her parents moved to Africa from India. She was my second African American girlfriend. Later I dated a black girl from Jackson, MS. She took great offense at being called African American because she is American. African American, according to her, is a racist term used by elitist blacks who are trying to feed white guilt or guilty whites with no sense of themselves. That is why I enjoyed dating her, she wasn’t afraid of honesty or reality.","You're quite the player michael.monkey!  Can't wait to read about your next girl.","I can 't believe all the ridiculous comments because of the title. I would imagine that is the original title people, not some racist comment from the flickr uploader. Its a good picture, get over it okay?","I am from Cincinnati, and have so often tried to imagine the faces of people who inhabited the city in the past, from the crucial time of the Underground Railroad onward. This picture is extremely powerful, and I am so glad it has been saved.","I'm not sure the point of adding yet another comment on the title, but personally, I LOVE the title. It is a piece of history.  I understand that the currents of history colour the subtext of the word &quot;negro&quot; in a negative way, but the contemporary subtext of the word had no negative connotation.  \n\nSome folks want to toe the line between preserving history and placating today's overly-sensitive masses by suggesting that &quot;back then, they didn't know any better&quot;.  But it is not the photographer or his contemporaries that didn't know better: it's WE who don't know any better--the degree to which we've coddled and insulated ourselves against any objection anyone might raise anywhere about anything that is deemed offensive for whatever reason. \n\nLet us remember that in arguably the most stirring example of rhetoric for the equality of races in America, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used the word &quot;negro&quot; fifteen times to describe his own people.  Are we to assume that Dr. King was ignorant or didn't know any better?  That he was one given to submitting to the whims of the time, even if he knew it was degrading?  The term was NOT degrading, but simply descriptive. Its degrading connotation is an after taste of decades of iniquity and struggle.  \n\nI expect my viewpoint to be lent little credence, uninformed as it is by the necessity of personal experience, but: if I were descended from this spirited, egregiously wronged, but ultimately triumphant lineage, I'd think I'd want to embrace such a term as &quot;negro&quot;, if only to invoke the power of continuity, history, solidarity, and oneness: uniting each new victory in an ongoing struggle to the trials from which it was born.\n\nI understand the desire to close ugly chapters of our past, and adopting new lexicon is one means of doing that.  But I think zealously whitewashing those things which are reminders of past iniquities, when the reminders themselves are innocuous, is in its own way one more form of binding and fragmenting a truly beautiful people whose whole story is incomparably rich and deserving of our entire attention and respect, not this piecemeal selective memory that passes for sensitivity.\n\n--\n<i>Seen on my Flickr home page.</i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\">?</a>)</em>","wow i never thought there would be this much hoopla over a title. i like the word &quot;negro&quot; to be honest/ it not necessarily meaning &quot;black &quot; in english terms, but all shades of brown. i hate the terms &quot;african american&quot; and &quot;black&quot;  because i am neither one of those things.","I keep coming back to this - firstly because its a great shot and secondly to reread Joe Wigfall's comment.....","it cracks me up at how some people react to reality..I guess some people don't know their history..had the title been changed, this would just be another childs portrait. some need to see things for what they are..fantastic post by the way..cheers","My girlfriend says I'm (so) white. White is a colour - I checked on the internet, it knows everything - so I'm coloured. So I'm black. \nSuch a great picture! Someone says it was restored? Like, how? The col..., I mean, the hues? The defintion? It's unbelievably sharp, with beautifully controlled depth of field.  Fantastic historical value too.","The title is ab-so-lute-ly perfect!  The picture is outstanding and I'm glad it's available for all to view and enjoy.  I feel fortunate to have this kind of historical record of a people who are just another part of Americana. \n\nThat said, I'm a woman and an American who has brown skin.  I don't care how others define me because definition of self is more important.  I claim American of African descent.  Call me &quot;negro&quot;, &quot;colored&quot;, &quot;black&quot; who cares just don't call me late for dinner.  \n\nLet's drop all this politically correct  BS and just be Americans.","For those who oppose: the photograph has done its job.","Totally agree.  Outstanding photo and title.  The people who disagree with the title are most likely non-black leftists who are seeking attention by supporting an unfounded cause.","Haha. I'm a White Leftist and I don't have any qualms with the title.","Wanderful portrait compliment!!!!!!!!","Well, I have no problem with the title personally. It's probably the original title like someone said above. \nEither way, it's a wonderful shot. I love older photos like this, and I can't help but be curious about the boy.","I like this picture so much!!!","I  like  the  tag-negro here  it  is  appropriate depicting the  boy  and  his  background  culture   accurately,  it  is  not  racially  prejudiced, the  picture  also  matches  perfectly  with the  title showing  a  small  negro  boy  who  is  proud  to  be  a  boy  of  hs  race","<strong>Che foto stupenda!!

Negro is just another word for black. The title is the historical title of record. We should not be so quick to judge what was appropriate in another time.

The expression and clothes are so serious and adult.","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro\">Negro</a> as defined in Wikipedia is actually pretty informative:\n\n<blockquote>Negro is a term referring to people of Black ancestry. Prior to the shift in the lexicon of American and worldwide classification of race and ethnicity in the late 1960s, the appellation was accepted as a normal neutral formal term both by those of Black African descent as well as non-African blacks. Now it is often considered an ethnic slur although the term is considered archaic and is not common as a racist slur. <b>The term is still used in some contexts for historical reasons</b> such as in the name of the United Negro College Fund. &quot;Negro&quot; means &quot;black&quot; in Spanish, Portuguese, and ancient Italian - all of which derive from the Latin niger (i.e. &quot;black&quot;).</blockquote>\n\nSeems obvious this is an appropriate historical context, no?\n\nBy the way, I find the photo both technically and emotionally extremely compelling.

No one person can speak for an entire race of people, so because an individual says that the title works for them, doesn't exactly make it work for everyone. There are some excellent points made by some of the commenters, although my question is, would there be a title depicting color or race if the child were &quot;white&quot;? With that in mind, I'd prefer to see a title that only said &quot; a boy near Cincinnati, Ohio...&quot; with maybe a description of the times and what the title may have included during that era.

In any case, the word &quot;Negro&quot; wasn't considered derogatory in its day.\n\nWhile I understand people's comments questioning the need to put a qualifier to designate a person's color, doing so would be counterproductive, in some ways. The &quot;default&quot; in the U.S. is &quot;white&quot; (and I'm speaking as a minority here, so this is an issue that affects me daily), so attempts to not address race at all in some ways cover over the issue-- and so we're left with the &quot;default&quot; of the same majority viewpoints. I specifically found this photograph because I wanted to find photographs that documented African-American life in the mid 20th century. If no &quot;color&quot; label had been added, it would have been lost in the sea of photographs documenting white America—which seem to be the majority of the photographs in the Commons.","Going back with an eraser and removing terms like this from original content is like trying to bury a part of history.  It also would change the meaning and significance of the picture.\nThe picture itself has a very deep feeling to it and whoever took it should be proud to have captured such an image.","The title is fine, leave it as is. That was at that period of time. I can't speak for all black people but my mother got into fights with white kids in the 30's and 40s that refered to her as black, because the way they used black was to hurt  and demean, the same as &quot;Nigras&quot; and the other dreaded &quot;N&quot; word. To have used the term Black Boy at that time would have been insulting because even the word 'Boy&quot; was used by adlut white men to demean my father and other black men. I am not one of these ultra-sensitive, PC types so the title is kool with me, especially  when I can think of all the negative names we have been called thru the years, coon, spook, darkie, monkey, spear-chucker, jungle bunny, boy, son, n_ _ _ _ _ , blackie, nigras,tar baby, liver lips,   <a href=\"http://video.aol.com/video-detail/saturday-night-live-saturday-night-live-word-association/899719308\">video.aol.com/video-detail/saturday-night-live-saturday-n...</a>","lol HurricanHelmet.......i think the problem that so many of us have with the title &quot;Negro Boy..&quot; is that &quot;Negro&quot; is not a name we people of African descent have given ourselves.  Self determination is fundamental to nationality.  All people seek some degree of nationhood, and self determination is integral to this primitive, and intrinsically human concept.","Wow, beautiful image.","This is a great photo. Who cares if you are politically correct or not. Some people don't realize that older people were raised calling people of color different things. My Pap-Paw, who was nearly 90, called them the Horrid &quot;N&quot; word. I would have NEVER corrected him. I may not have liked it, but I cannot re-raise someone 90 years old to name something they have called one thing their entire life something different. It isn't my place. \n\nI know I am not black, african american, or whatever... But I don't see why everyone has to get bent out of shape over the name of a photo. I am a white girl, I am not gonna get ticked if you call me a Wasp or a Cracker or a B***H. It's just a way to describe someone. If that's the word the artist wanted to use then so be it. I am soooo tired of political correctness!\n\n GREAT PHOTO, GREAT CAPTURE! Beautiful child!","Limejuno, I am not attempting to be disrespectful! I think I understand your point, but I have to disagree. If the group you were designated to, was referred to as the &quot;Bitches&quot;, and this is the box you had to check on forms...I'm not sure that you'd have the same opinion.Many people are raised doing or saying certain things, but regardless of age, it may not be acceptable, and sometimes we have to speak out and do the right thing, even if it's not acceptable. In today's society, if your Pap-Paw referred to my child in those terms, would that be okay? Overall, I'm not really hearing many get &quot;bent out of shape&quot; over the name of the photo. What I hear is people expressing their respective thoughts on the issue. In fact, the bent out of shape seems to come more from a defensive tone.  Dialogue is a good thing, and it's awesome that a simple photo can illicit so much conversation! Believe it or not, but there is a racial divide in this world, and it's okay to talk about it in a positive way.","Hermosooo","What a cute and lovely boy here!\n\nAbsolutely fantastic portrait.

It was acceptable and what most blacks referred to themselves as.  \n\nIf you ever get a chance, go to your Public Library and look at old copies of Ebony Magazine or Jet Magazine from that era and even later.

On January 26, 2008 my father was killed in a tragic car accident that took place only 2 minutes away from my home. My parents had been married for 30 years at the time of the accident without separation. As I have been assisting my mother with putting together various lawsuits and claims against several different persons, insurance companies, and even the Los Angeles Police Department regarding several acts of negligence and dishonor surrounding my fathers death, I have come across a disturbing piece of information that I, being a 24 year old African American person am appauled. My father having been born on April 9, 1955, has a birth certificate that identifies his color and race as being &quot;NEGRO.&quot; My grandmother, Eloise Marie Harrison having been born on April 4, 1933 has a birth certificate that identifies her color and race as being &quot;NEGRO&quot;. My mother, who is still alive, Clancyna Marie Atkins born on September 4, 1956 has a birth certificate that identifies her color and race as being &quot;NEGRO&quot; as well.  And I am quite sure there are thousands if not milliions of other African American people dead or alive who have been identified on paper at birth as being &quot;NEGRO&quot; I am absolutely disgusted that the United States of America even in 2009 have not made an attempt to make right this defamation of character in administering all new birth certificates to those who have died as well as those still living to identify these HUMAN PEOPLE with dignity and respect. I am passionately committed to make my fathers name wholly reflect the honorable father, husband, and man that he was and the fact that his life was not even given an opportunity to start before he was branded on United States of America paper as being a &quot;NEGRO&quot; is a disgrace and a shame on America.\n \nPLEASE SUPPORT THIS MESSAGE TO THE WHITE HOUSE BY SIGNING MY ONLINE PETITION at: <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/online/29117.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gopetition.com/online/29117.html</a>\n \nIf you have any questions e- mail me at: kingdom.servant.dani@gmail.com\n \nThank You,\nDani","lol","Who\n\nfreaking\n\ncares","Beautiful boy.","Don't be ridiculous my friends..the title is correct and the photo is fantastic....&quot;You have no reason to be ashamed of your \nancestors.

Don't get all up tight about the title. It's just a word used to describe the subject matter. If this photo were taken today it would be different. But it was taken in the 1940's and that was the word used. HISTORICAL PHOTO!","very nice!!","Racism","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/more_pi-dah] \n\nExcellent point.","Truly fantastic!\nAll this commotion about a word makes me sick...","Some pictures just have that certain something that makes them pop.

Great job on this!\n\n<a href=\"http://firstcliq.com/webdesign.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cincinnati Web Design</a>","I agree that the title of the photo should be left alone.  It's the way people looked at us then.  As a Black child growing up in the 50's and 60's, I didn't like the word Negro and couldn't figure out why.  As I grew older I figured it out.  I see myself as a Black American.  They tell me that my ancestors are in Africa.  Historically the people left in Africa  are the ones who's  ancestors made my fore bearers slaves to begin with.  So African American doesn't do it for me.","There is a good chance this little boy is now a 70+ year old man still living in Ohio.  I wonder what his thoughts are on the photo and the title. \n\nI wonder if he would be surprised the photo still exists and that it stirs controversy so many years later.\n\nWhen I look at it, I don't see so much a race issue. I think about the the error and the 400,000 American military men who have died or will be dead in the next three years from when this shot was taken. Or the 13 million people who will die in Nazi concentration camps before May 1945 arrives.\n\nMy guess is this little boy was also more concerned with  the fact that the most terrible war the world has ever seen was taking place around him. He probably saw the Western Union man delivering death notices to the families around him, maybe even to his own home. WWII was a part of every Americans life at the time.","Compliments, I like it; Please add this photo to\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1046032@N20/\"> <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/buddyicons/1046032@N20.jpg?1239274945\" /> &quot;as beautiful as you want&quot; </a> group","Piercing eyes, effective light, excellent portrait.","Zowie!

I wonder if this kid might be still alive somewhere in my hometown, obviously he'd be much older.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/38167147@N02] Ok and what's your point, before the civil rights movement it was ok to call black folk by derogative names, it was ok to lynch black folk, seperatism was ok ??\nyou seem to be defending the use of the word by stating it was before the civil rights movement but surely the civil rights movement changed things for the better consigning racism to the dustbin ???","i like the title, i think the word &quot;negro&quot; sounds good. of course it has some historical &quot;sticked meanings&quot;, but i never use that way. funny when the political correctness make the people subconscious racist. i'm not afraid say the word &quot;negro&quot; becase i don't use  the contra productive way of political &quot;correctness&quot;. being a negro is a good thing, not a shame, and i don't give a f*ck the politicians &quot;teaching&quot;. the word is just a shell, the individual filling up with subject matter. if you are racist (directly or subconscious) you filled up with bad meanings. \n\nanyway: how cool as he wearing that hat! :)","Its not a great pic. It good a little black in dungarees and a bowler of course its cute. But the titles draws attention. And thats why it has so many comments, nothing to do with the talent of taken a picture.","Uh, how many color images of black children from 1942 have you seen that were this sharp and clean?  It's possibly the best color portrait of a child I have seen from this period.  I think it is definitely a wonderful piece of the Library of Congress collection.","trolllll!!!!!","@92Sasquatch, are you calling me a troll?  If so, WHY?  I am expressing my opinion that this is one of the best color photos I have ever seen of a black child from the early 1940s.  I have viewed hundreds of thousands of photographs from the 1940s.  This is an excellent photo.  Also, there is nothing wrong with the title because it was given this title in 1942 when black people in America were called Negroes.  In fact, they were called Negroes routinely until the late sixties when they expressed the desire to be called Blacks.  Negro means Black in several different languages.  Become informed.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/elenafedeli] \n\nObviously it is the original title from 1942","Love the outfit.. Wish I lived back then. Miss film. Brilliant photo.","Martinus, why do you wish you lived back then?  I don't think it'd be an easy life in any way.","no change no see","Amazing!","The older I get, the more I realize that it's mostly &quot;whites&quot; who take the most offence at the &quot;racist&quot; terms that they historically created. \n\nWhen I worked with a company that was largely black, I asked them which terms they were offended by. \n\nNone objected to being called 'black'. It's a pretty neutral term, heavily dependant on a supportive context to make it racist. \n\nSome of the older blacks still used 'colored', but it has fallen out of common useage mainly because it's antiquated -- old fashioned-like. It's usually construed as racist only in the overall context of segregation.  \n\nSome were less keen on 'negro', but still used it occasionally. The problem they had was that, culturally, it has taken on a similar (but less intense) meaning as 'Uncle Tom'. \n\nAfrican-American is acceptable, but it's an awkward term that has its own implications of being racist without seeming racist. &quot;You're American but you're also AFRICAN-American&quot;. As if to remind everyone that they're in a special class; African first and American by convenience or grace. \n\nAnd despite what the media and it's lauded Rap stars would have people believe, I can't think of any of the blacks I worked with who did not despise the use of 'n-----'. That one, hands down, is taken as an insult. Even when used among themselves, it's insulting. Albeit, arguably less than insulting than when a non-black uses it.","<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/9688250@N02/\">www.flickr.com/photos/9688250@N02/</a>\nThe problem is that uninformed younger people equate &quot;Negro&quot; with the &quot;n word.&quot;  For many, many years, people of African descent used the term Negro to refer to themselves, and, in fact, a few older ones still do today.  The 2010 U.S. census included a category &quot;Negro&quot; for the very reason some people still use this term to identify themselves.  The term almost certainly started in the early 18th century when Spanish and Portuguese traders referred to Africans as being negro (which means black in both Spanish and Portuguese).  I do not believe the term as originally used was meant to degrade people of African origin.  Where it becomes &quot;racist&quot; was when slave owners and traders in the Southern U.S. assimilated the word to &quot;nigra&quot;.  This and the &quot;N Word&quot; became synonymous with the black slave.  Although the blacks in the South were freed by Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, they never were truly &quot;freed&quot; from the prejudice and injustice they received mostly in the South.  So, derogatory terms used by some Southerners for them continue to this day to be considered offensive.  However, the terms &quot;Negro&quot; and &quot;Colored&quot; were never really considered by most African Americans to be offensive until the late 1960's.  IMHO, the &quot;N Word&quot; is offensive because it is forever linked to the image of the slave, the subservient being under the White man.  If black people want to use the word to refer to one another, that is up to them.  I wish it would go away, but it won't.  And I don't think we should ever forget that it was not that many years ago that blacks were routinely lynched for the only &quot;crime&quot; of being born with dark skin.  We should never forget that in the 1920's, there were still millions of members of the KKK who viewed blacks as subhuman.  Even today, we have people such as Ted Nugent referring to our President as being subhuman.  It's sad and it is sick.  \n\nBut, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the use of Negro in the title of this photo since it was titled in 1942.","Please would you consider \njoining and adding your \nexcellent work to the group \n*PEOPLE ~ we love people!\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/colourfulmoments/\">www.flickr.com/groups/colourfulmoments/</a>\n\nMany thanks :-)\nAnne (admin)","It's beyond me, the commenters who *do not understand* that the original caption is part of the HISTORICAL VALUE of this image—besides it being an incredibly wonderful portrait of this boy.

Its been about 10 years since I've been in the &quot;mushroom gardens&quot; as it was called.    Before Ed Weir, they ran outdoor meets inside the stadium proper.   You'd run straight along the east and west side of the football field, then run around the sweeping curves at the north and south ends.   There used to be storage areas on the the north and south ends of the east and west stadiums.  These areas stored the hurdles and gear the meets needed.

Long\nSubmitted by Charles David Long on Fri, 11/27/2009 - 11:57pm.\n\nC.A. Long was my great-grandfather. The building in the photo was constructed in 1896 for the International Order of Odd Fellows. The Lodge used the top story for its meetings and rented the ground floor. Charles Anderson Long (1859-1939) moved his grocery business from Williamsburg, Ohio, to Mount Orab in 1931.\n\nThe business before C.A. rented it in 1931 was a shop that assembled horse buggies (see second photo below). Charles rented the building for his grocery business. His son Julius Paul Long had taken over the grocery in 1939 after C.A.'s death. My father, J.P.

Cowboys were an product of the Americans 1850 arrival in the Southwest and adopting, then changing, the vaquero culture that existed.  The vaquero culture used specific equipment, lassos of 120 feet intead of the cowboys 60 foot lassos. The vaquero were on open ranges while cowboys fenced the ranches. I can assure you the photo was on a fenced ranch. And those are not vaqueros. There are some that are trying to keep the vaquero culture alive, but they are rare.","Just look at the clarity of this !

The obesity epidemic began in the late 1980's, early 1990's, caused by many factors non-existent 40, 50, 60 years ago, like food addiction and food as therapy and ginormous, super-sized portions at restaurants, movie theaters, etc.\n\nI graduated high school in 1980, and there was only ONE fat student in my entire graduating class.

Whinery, baby boy is Lawrence Whinery.\nThe girls: Oldest girl is Laura Whinery, Wanda Whinery is in white, and Velva Whinery is in pink.\n\nVelva's middle name is Mae, and her obituary is <a href=\"http://www.gjfreepress.com/article/20070531/OBITUARIES/70530018&amp;SearchID=73291354590210\">here</a>. It says she was born in Adrin, TX, Lawrence and Wanda passed away before Velva, and as far as I know Laura and A.J are still alive. At the time of Velva's passing, Laura lived in Clifton, CO with the married name Murray, and Jack lived in Clifton. It doesn't say which of the many Cliftons it is, so I am guessing it is Clifton, TX. A married name was not listed for Wanda, so I assume she never married.\n\nWhile I found the obit. on the internet, I found the names of the other children while in Pie Town the other day. It was a photographer's dream!","Miss Mikaela, that's really cool to know their names and fates.  I appreciate your posting all that.","Happy to share, Ms Penny! I was so elated to find the information myself, and knew others had to be wondering some of the same things I was about the family.","Cassie's Grandma-\nJack (First name: Abrim. Second name: Jackson. Surname: Whinery) was born on June 11, 1907. That would have made him 33 years old when this picture was taken. I have looked and looked, but have yet to find the birth-date of Edith (First name: Laura. Second name: Edith. Maiden surname: Evans. Married surname: Whinery), but I do agree that she was most likely younger than Jack, as was almost always the case in that time.  Can you believe it, after this was taken they had two more children together (Meriam Marcie Whinery and Floyd M. Whinery)? Albeit they still only had six living with them, as Lawrence died in 1944\n\nOh, wait, here we go! One source says that Edith was born on May 5, 1909, making her 30 years old in this picture, though I can't verify it. Man, it took me long enough to find that information!  At this rate I'll never get this school project done!","Thanks for all your hard work on research.

Kosakowski of Grand Junction died on May 27, 2007 at age 75.\n\nA memorial service will be held , May 31 at 11 a.m. at the VFW off 30 Rd. and I-70 B on Florence Rd.\n\nVelva was born on Aug. 29, 1931 in Adrin, Texas, to Jack and Edith Whinery.\n\nShe married Clifford Miller on Nov. 4, 1956. To this marriage was born two daughters, Carla Seybold of Wall, S.D.; and Sandra Hart of Grand Junction; two sons, Cliff Miller Jr. of Grand Junction; and Bobby Miller of Grand Junction. She married Chester Kosakowski, age 81, on Oct. 31, 2005. She had numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nWe will miss her.\n\nSurvivors include Laura Murray of Clifton; A.J. Whinery of Dayton, Nev.; Floyd Whinery of Clifton; Rose Hampton of Evanston, Wyo.; and Jean Herron of Grand Junction.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her mother and father, her brother, Lawrence Whinery and sister, Wanda Whinery.","<a href=\"http://www.shorpy.com/node/1595\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.shorpy.com/node/1595</a>\n\nProvided this info \n\nInformation about the Whinery children\nSubmitted by Alexandra on Mon, 04/27/2009 - 10:08pm.\n\nI was in Pie Town a few days ago and managed to find the name of all the Whinery children. The oldest girl is Laura; Velva (middle name &quot;Mae&quot;) is in pink, and Wanda is in white. The eldest boy is A.J, and the baby boy's name is Lawrence.\n\nI know for certain that Wanda, Velva, and Lawrence have died. Wanda was born in Adrin, Texas on August 29, 1931 and died on May 27, 2007 at the age of 75. She was married twice, to Clifford Miller on Nov 4, 1956, and she had four children, two boys and two girls, and Chester Kosakowski, age 81, on Oct 31, 2005. In her obituary it says that Wanda and Lawrence preceded her in death, Wanda likely unmarried as they referred to her as Wanda Whinery instead of with a married name. It also said that Laura and A.J. survived her, so unless they have passed away in the meantime, Laura is living in Clifton, Colorado, with the married name Murray, and A.J is living in Dayton (it doesn't say which of the 23 Daytons in the US, so I'm guessing it is Dayton, TX)\n\nI talked to a man who lived in Pie town for all of his life, and he said that he doesn't think the Whinery home is still there. Neither is the Farm Bureau building that the children went to school in. On the other hand, one of the other school buildings is still there and being re-stuccoed and made into a residential home. Their current public schools are in Datil and Quemado, none in Pie Town. The current population of Pie Town is approximately 60 people, and the Pie-O-Neer has better pie than The Daily Pie.","Thanks to all of you for this great research into the Whinery family.

The book sounds like it would be very helpful to anyone doing research on the lives of homesteaders in Pie Town.  Check with your local library!","I need to comment on the whole collection now.  I was a toddler when these pictures were made.  The FSA which paid the photographers to document America at that time was a &quot;New Deal&quot; program of FDR.  I remember when he died.  I also remember when JFK was assassinated  The mood of the country was the same both times.  I think the closest event in recent times is the death of Princess Diana.  I mention that so the younger generation will have an inkling of what I am trying to express.  These pictures portray our country at a time when the economy was so far worse than it is now that there is really no comparison.  The reason why our current economic plight is not as terrible as the Great Depression is entirely due to radical changes initiated by FDR.  When the Great Depression struck the country toward the end of the Hoover administration, there was no agency in the federal government available for assistance of any kind.  It was a purely capitalilstic economy, and except for a few weak and outdated laws passed to restrict monopolies, there was no government regulation of anything.  Likewise, there was no government encouragement of anything, either.  There was very little government at all, which sounds like the current idealism of what is called The Tea Party.  It is also the idealism of large corporations.  \n\nThe very existence of these pictures is a direct result of the New Deal programs of FDR.  Besides this beautiful collection, there are thousands of black-and-white prints  made all over the country, many of them now famous icons.  America needs to look back to see what kind of country we had before FDR before we decide to go back to those &quot;good old days.&quot;  These pictures are a good way to do that looking.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/hauntedpalace] I agree","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/16909288@N00] Amen!","What an absolutely, magically, timeless image.

This is probably as the dancers have been around the circle and met their partners, where they would 'swing'.","Definitely before McDonald's.","this is awesome. they all look rather drear and unhappy though","People were very poor. Food was in short supply. You don't get fat on poke salad, corn pone and pinto beans.","looks kinda like the two ladies are about to go at it , the man maybe trying to hold her back?

The handkerchief was a necessity if you didn't want to drip sweat continuously.

And a dance was the perfect opportunity to meet possible partners.","he could of been using the handkerchief ( the one in the hand ) to wipe blood from a fight he had been in , back in those days and those places you had to be polite and respect other people's clothes , shoes , wallpaper ,etc. he probably just changed someone's attitude and maybe a lesson in etiquette. ( just maybe )","All you need - a fiddle and guitar. In NH, a small, 3-4 piece band which played for square dances might be called an orchestra.","I painted this girl:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinestephens/4298770440/\">www.flickr.com/photos/christinestephens/4298770440/</a>","I thought I would try to bring back some of the colour. This one is faded, and has shifted to purple, and I have a feeling that the film stock used was not great, or in some way unstable, but I've done what I can. As to film stock, for some reason, this data is not included in LOC's records for any of its colour images from this period, which is too bad, because it can be crucial to restoration efforts.\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonemacduff/5547531094/in/album-72157626318408042/\">www.flickr.com/photos/theonemacduff/5547531094/in/album-7...</a>","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonemacduff], most of the FSA/OWI slides are Kodachrome. They are stored off-site in cold storage so it's not easy to quickly check each one.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jon_loc]  Yup, I figured that was the case, based on work I've done on others, but it's nice to have confirmation. But this one was so badly faded, shifted so much towards purple, that my thought was that somehow the flash being used was not a good balance for Kodachrome, that the faux colour was baked into the slide from the moment the shutter was tripped. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about early flash bulbs or the 1930s chemistry of Kodachrome to figure it out.\n\nBTW, while the slides were scanned at 3600dpi, by the time you crop away the slide mount area, you're down to 3000-3100dpi, and personally, I would say that a 35mm slide shot through good glass – as these were – should be scanned at a minimum of 4800dpi. This is about enough so that you can begin to make out grain in the image. The larger file size also allows you greater freedom to sharpen, if you want to, and gives smoother colour transitions, and better shadow detail. Jest sayin'.","Series Titile:  Scene at the brown paper inn\r\nA picture is worth a thousand words, right?  Well, there's a full story or two hidden in this group of photos.

Looks more like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)\">Balboa</a> (wikipedia.org):\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Balboa is a form of swing dance that started as early as 1915 and gained in popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. It is danced primarily in close embrace, and is led with a full body connection...  The dancers stand close, touching from hip to upper chest...  The man's right front torso (rib cage) touches the woman's center front torso (rib cage).&quot;</blockquote>","That's not how I learned to square dance!  I would have to agree with WaiferX on this one.","Could be balboa, or another early dance like the Peabody.  Given the year given (and the clothing seems to agree), I'd have to say balboa or a derivative.\r\n\r\nA square dance is sometimes a &quot;called&quot; dance, so it could be truly a square dance where they called a move that just happens to look like balboa.   \r\n\r\nLots of possibilities.","Could be at what folks called a 'square dance', where there were some 'called' square dances [Honolulu Baby, Just Because, Red River Gal, etc.] and also quite a few waltzes, foxtrots, polkas, interspersed.","great pic!","I know Balboa when I see it  :D","the angel of death and the scythe for making harvest.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/418630@N20/\">&quot;I Love Oklahoma&quot;</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","So lovely","I think those are young cotton plants.","yes, cotton or okra, definitely something in Malvaceae.","The soil looks like it isn't so great.","Interesting beams, they are formed concrete, evident by the indents along the sides where you can see the granules from the mix, and caused by the boards in the form.","I disagree. Those are wood timbers. Concrete beams of that length were not in use at that time. Large trees were still available to make such long beams. Since the picture was taken in 1939 or 1940, the building would have been from a much earlier era.","it's a tough call...looks like you can see the indents from boards in a form but anyhoo...the Roman colisseum was constructed of concrete CK42.","Look at the first beam in the larger version and you'll see obvious signs of forming over the support where the edges of boards are seen and gravel texture peaks out on the sides.  There are also dings in the too perfect corners of the top edges.\n\nThe length of the concrete beams was why I thought this was so interesting for its time period.  Most of the wood has been removed from the building, and beams of that size in that length would be too valuable to leave.","Fort Washita, perhaps? <a href=\"http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Fort_Washita\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Fort_Washita</a>","More about Fort Washita here <a href=\"http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v007/v007p175.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v007/v007p175.html</a>","Good guess.

The haystacks were kept outside, and they were shaped to shed water.  If they were used during the first winter after they were made, rotting of the hay from moisture was minimal.  It wouldn't have been practical to keep all the hay inside because such a great quantity of hay was harvested each year to see the cattle through the long winter.  I think this was probably true in 1940 in Colorado also.  Also, keep in mind that the annual rainfall isn't that much in Colorado.  The main reason to keep hay inside is to avoid water damage.","<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/buddyicons/21589081@N04.jpg?1196922002\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" /> This looks a lot like the haystacks my father made when I was a kid.  He had a large rectangular form on wheels that resembled a large cage with vertical bars on the side where the entire back section butterflied open to allow pulling the form away once the hay was stacked inside - leaving a nice rectangular stack that very much resembles the one in this photo.\r\nThe form is very similar to the one in this <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ssmt/518091545/\">photo</a> from <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ssmt/\">John Means Whatever</a>'s photostream","Prairie Bluestem is right on. Each area of the country had their own system of haying. This stack could have been  put up with either an overshot or beaver slide stacker. After the stack reached a certain height the stacker was drug several feet and continued, although it does appear to have been stacked in distinct layers.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the heigth was to get more tons protected with the smallest surface area, leaving little to the elements. If you go by the Haythorn Ranch at Arthur, NE you can see this still done with horses.","I want to amend my comments on the hay stack listed just above. With the above mentioned stackers the guys on top had to spread the hay with forks to the end and edges of the stack. It took some doing, but but with care the sides could be kept straight.","This is one reason why I LOVE old photographs! I take it this was taken in summer, instead of just seeing the season, you can almost feel the heat of summer coming off this picture, the colour is so vibrant, it`s hard to explain. Lovely picture! Thank You!","A co-worker mentioned that we have 16mm movie footage showing hay being stacked in the 1940s on the Ninety-Six Ranch in Nevada, with a locally made derrick.  Accompanied by explanations and new technology videotaped in the 1980s by the Library's American Folklife Center.\r\n\r\nTo check it out: <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ncrhtml/crmenu3.html\">memory.loc.gov/ammem/ncrhtml/crmenu3.html</a>   \r\n\r\n(Searching this American Memory collection using the word &quot;hay&quot; gets you a lot of stills too: <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ncrquery.html\">memory.loc.gov/ammem/ncrquery.html</a> )","As Colorado Kid 42 says, this could be stacked by folks who knew what they were doing. It is a larger scale of what my father did on a hayrack pulled by horses in the fields of our NH hill farm. Placing each pitched-on fork-full of hay in the right place and then treading it down kept it on for the sometimes bumpy ride to the barn. Then, the hay was unloaded with a pitchfork and pitched into the haymows in the barn. Very hot work in a humid NH summer.","wow very n ice","Hi, let's share this great photo with Günün En İyisi - The Best of Day (Post 1 - Comment 3)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/iyibest/\">www.flickr.com/groups/iyibest/</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/iyibest/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2314/2279756290_49c60749d0_t.jpg\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Günün En İyisi - The Best of Day\r\nPlease tag your photo: GününEnİyisi, TheBestOfDay</strong>","Stumbled on this photo from Wales in 1910.

The mountainous road really impresses me because it seems like it takes lots of hard work to build roads through mountains.  The fact that they were doing this before 1941 impresses me even more.","Yes, Old Freezeout still exists. A faster less curvy road is used for most traffic, but you can still take the Old Freezeout route alternate.  Like t8rtart I road over it with my grandfolks many times. We preferred to explore the old road with all it's pioneer history. There used to be a monument to pioneers on teh road, but it was moved to Emmett Idaho to preserve it. There were a lot of stories of adventure and outlaws on old freezeout hill from folks in Emmett.","I f you look to the right and above old freeze out road you will see a cut in the hill side.  That is the ramainder of the Old Bayse road which was build to bypass the original steep freeze out road, which went down one of the steep ridges into the valley.  Bayse built this road with less of a grade so he could get lumber out of the Payette River Valley, (Emmett-where he had a saw mill) over to Boise.  As you drive the 'old freezeout road' you can see the rest of the ramains of the Bayse road as it descends into the valley.  \n\nThe original freezeout road was part of the (Tom) Goodale cutoff from the Oregon Trail,  in an attempt to shorten the distance from  Boise to Payette.","I wonder why it is &quot;No Truck Parking&quot; in the gap between the cars there?","Beer, Drugs, Cafe, and Beer read the storefront signs.

Please click on the &quot;Invite this photo to...&quot; link below the comment box and we'll accept it.","Old school manual labor!  So many questions I'd like to ask these two...","Would those be telephone or telegraph lines?","the hi res LOC scan of this is soft.","They are telephone lines, rural telephone companies were often co-ops financed by guaranteed loans through the Rural Electrification Administration.  Thanks to FDR.\n(A telegraph line was a single wire, the earth was the return side of the circuit.  Telephone lines were pairs of wires.  Up to ten subscribers could share one pair -- a party line.  It looks like about fifteen pairs on these poles, so that could be as many as 150 telephones, but was probably about 50 on party lines and five to ten expensive private lines)","Amazing landscape; colors are so vivid!  I'd have never guessed this was possible for photography of this era.","Power line on the horizon.  If this is Greene County, Georgia, the poles and wires belong to the members of Rayle EMC (Electric Membership Cooperative).  The Frankliln D. Roosevelt Administration initiated a lot of new government agencies to rescue the country from the Great Depression.  Among those programs was the Rural Electrification Administration which was empowered to provide or guarantee low intererst loans to Electric Membership Cooperatives.  No 'for profit' electric utility would take the loss of building the grid where only one or two subscribers were available per mile of line.  The EMCs saved the day and electrified all of that part of America that would still be in the dark today without the foresight of one of our greatest presidents.","The trouble with Greene County is that it has no landmarks, like Brasstown Bald.  So you can't tell which way you are looking in this picture, or even for certain that you are in Greene County.","I wonder if this isn't an old plantation house.  Notice the columns on the front porch.  The brick chimneys were originally stuccoed.  And there's an enormous magnolia tree in the side yard.","&quot;Baby Doll!  Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaby Dollllll!&quot;","Looks more like clapboard/planking than log. Log would show greater depth in the places where some was mising and you wouldn't see that sort of &quot;chunk&quot; out of the board about oh, eight up from the bottom on the left.","It is fascinating to see the Georgia State flag in this photograph.  It was often suggested, during the fierce debates in the late 1990's and 2000 about removing the Confederate battle emblem from the Georgia State flag, that to remove the battle emblem was to reject history.  This photo is a good reminder of the reality of the situation.  (The Confederate battle emblem was added to the Georgia State flag only in 1956; if anything, the current flag, adopted in 2003, is actually closer to the historical flag, based on the Stars and Bars, as seen in this photo, than was the battle emblem flag adopted in 1956.)","Thats planking/clapboard not log.","Bargeboard. Patriotic apron.","Looks more like rough planking/clapboard than log... notice the framing where some planking is gone.","I believe that's a drying shed for tobacco","haha :)","Probably a Soil Conservation meeting. The map on the rear wall is a soils map. Each color represents a different soil type. The lighter color a hill and the dark is bottom land.","I think those maps are of Greene County, Georgia.

They're cutting the stalks and then turning them under the soil surface.  Usually people practice no-till farming these days.","They look awefully dressed up to be in the field chopping cotton.","Right you are.

I see grass/weeds that they are 'chopping' but no cotton. One of the earlier photos shows some plant, I assume cotton, a few inches high in rows that the people are working around with hoes but not here and they should be high enough to show up. Is this just a very labor-intensive way to prepare last years ground for the new planting?","They probably couldn't afford any major pieces of equipment.  It was a cheap but labor intensive tillage method involving chopping down the old cotton plant stalks and turning any plant material under the soil surface.","Looks like sugarcane forground left side....","I am noting the even distribution of labor. No glass ceiling here.","I'm pretty sure Jack posed them---you can tell by their faces and posturing.

The month of October would be a slack time for ag workers in 1939 since the cotton crop would be slowly maturing without the plant steroids we have today. Its also the time of least rainfall. Cotton picking done by hand would start in the next month or so, I believe. The creek could be Wasp Lake which is an ancient Yazoo River channel.

The other image cut off most of the people.  I love both images - it simply never crossed my mind that I might be looking at a bit of a much bigger image.\n\nShows how much I have to learn about presenting photos","Aside from the grubby hat worn by the older girl in the previous cropped version of this scene, that shot didn't say &quot;poor&quot; to me: the kids were well-scrubbed and their clothes freshly washed. This larger, more expansive photo however tells a much different story.\n\nI suspect the combination of these two photos was a deliberate illustrative effort by the photographer - interesting. The close-up photo said to me, &quot;These people could be part of your community&quot;; this one says &quot;Man, what's up with these people - what happened to them?&quot;. The combination of the two photos gives me greater respect for photography as an art form.","What an incredibly beautiful image!","Dressed in rags, living in a crumbling shack, working on a white man's farm, and not a single one can afford a pair of shoes; not much difference between 1840 and 1940.","Remember, this was 1940.  This was before LBJ's &quot;War on Poverty&quot;, these people were probably exploited farm pickers who made maybe a few dollars a day.  There were also poor whites who lived that way, too.  You realize there was no Medicaid back then, no Medicare, and Social Security was in its infancy.  But, rest assured these people had no social security.  They worked for cash.  Nothing more.  There were no birth control pills so women had children when they couldn't afford them.  It wasn't their fault any more than the men with whom they shared private moments.  I doubt anyone ever discussed family planning with them.  Children were always considered a blessing.  &quot;The Lord will provide&quot; and all that sort of justification.","The green and blue in this photos are just amazing.","stunning.","I am so glad that I got to see this","Very beautiful.","Lovely!","Anyone know what kind of film would give this result these days?

Along the Mississippi River levee this image really contradicts 'The Great Depression'.","Looks like corn being cultivated near the house, but it is only knee high.

It wasn't considered a negative term in those days as I hear.  Maybe they said two children since the third child is almost cut off.

According to the granddaughter of the original owners, the house used to be a fish and chips restaurant. During the Hurricane of 1938, it was one of the only houses still standing. There is a picture of the house with the entire bottom gutted out. To rebuild, the owners made sure the walls were reinforced with concrete and steel, to prevent any future damage to the vulnerable side facing the ocean.

Connecticut Shade was harvested leaf by leaf (&quot;Primings&quot; - usually 3 leaves at a time as they matured; 5-6 &quot;primings&quot; a season) and the leaves dried.  The photo shows end of the harvest; the shade cloth sidewall has been taken down &amp; the plants knocked down to rot into the soil as a green fertilizer.  The shade top cloth will come off next and be recycled as sidewall the next season.  You can see that the pole rows haven't been cut down yet - the plants are still pushing the top cloth up - they had to be cut by hand w/ machetes.","There is a 1961 film, Parrish, that I saw on AMC last month.

His son, Nicholas Dayos, was a friend of mine during our elementary, junior high, and high school days. He was killed a few years ago in a car crash. I am 75, and he was perhaps two years older.

As the law office of George L. Wainwright expanded, more windows were lettered in gold leaf, as was the parctice in those days.  The upper floors were mostly law offices and insurance agencies.  The lobby and stairway were marble and brass.  All of the office doorways had glass transoms.  The ground floor was all retail.  One of the stores, McCarthy's, was owned by a couple who perished in the famous Coconut Grove fire in Boston, but the business continued for many years thereafter.

Wainwright and Wainwright is now a three-generation family firm in Brockton.","Sylvia Sweets Tea Room\nMy father, John Dayos started Sylvia Sweets Tea Room in the early thirties.  He had worked for many years at Liggett’s Drug Store across the street as a “Patent Man” but after getting married in 1929, he soon decided he wanted to own his own business as so many Greek immigrants did.   He was a success story in that he had sold newspapers as a young immigrant boy on the same corner –School and Main Street many years before.  He and his business partners started out to open a candy store.   One of the stories I remember was that they bought a gas stove.  A lady came out to demonstrate the stove and suggested they could boil chicken and serve sliced chicken sandwiches, and chicken salad sandwiches.  This lady was Ruth Wakefield – later the owner of the well known Toll House Restaurant and the originator of the Toll House Cookie or the Chocolate Chip Cookie.  The sliced chicken sandwich was a specialty until the Sylvia Restaurant closed in the late 60’s.   Mrs. Wakefield always remembered my father by name whenever we went to the Toll House for special dinners.\n\nThe whole family at one time or another worked at “Sylvia’s”--my mother Effie, my brother Nick, my sister Dorothea and myself, Elaine.  Sylvia’s is often remembered in the Brockton newspaper ‘The Enterprise” column “From our Readers” as a downtown fixture – after the movies, catching a bus to and from the surrounding towns to shop in downtown Brockton,  and a high school hangout.  Sales people and office workers downtown were regulars for lunch and coffee breaks.   I remember well the two ladies who worked at McCarthy’s in the fifties and would come in on Friday night, when the stores were open until 9pm and order Salmon Salad on plain dark bread and my father would enjoy making it extra special for them every week – cut in fours with toothpicks.  .  \n\nIn the early fifties downtown Brockton was changing and the business was changing.  My parents decided to remodel the Tea Room which had beautiful mahogany paneling and booths, a marble soda fountain, black glass table tops and oval top mirrors.   It became a modern fifties luncheonette and the name was changed to Sylvia Restaurant and that was when I worked there.  My sister and I started out working by “typing the menus.”  Every day the specials changed and there was a typed menu that was added to the plastic covered Sylvia menu, which had an oval old-fashioned picture of “Sylvia.” (I wish I had a copy of that menu.)  I was told Sylvia was a pretty girl who came over on the Mayflower.  The Greek immigrants wanted to assimilate into American life so they thought the Mayflower was all American.  My mother remembered that when they first opened the Tea Room, she spoke to my father in Greek and he told her to go to the back room to talk to him, as customers didn’t like to hear a foreign language.  She was so upset, she vowed to learn English.  She attended night school and continued for many years, first for English and to become a citizen and then for other classes.  \n\nI vaguely remember when my father still made ice cream for the Tea Room.  Of course we only had Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry and Coffee and it was packed in those round Pint or Quart containers.  If  I happened to be there when he was making ice cream,  I would have soft strawberry before it was frozen and this was a special treat.  He told stories that during the depression, they were able to make a good living selling ice cream cones as families could afford a 5 cent ice cream cone.  Of course in those days one never visited someone’s home without a box of chocolates and originally candy was the main focus of the business.\n\nEveryone had his or her special food at Sylvia’s.  Mine was chopped ham and pickle and a strawberry milk shake.  I think I ate that every time I went there in my childhood days.  We would see a “regular” come in and have his coffee, tea or cold drink in front of him before he asked for it.  We had many bachelors that lived in the rooming houses near Main St. who would come in for their dropped eggs on toast for 35 cents in the fifties.  Many of them couldn’t afford much more and occasionally they would have a real lunch or dinner.  We often refered to people by what they ordered, not by their name, since we often didn’t know their name. \n\nI don’t remember the early days but I heard about them over the years.  Some of the stories reflect the family and community atmosphere of a local downtown tea room.  After the war, my dad gave jobs to many of the service men coming back home – many  went on to become successful Brockton business and professional men, some  to college and some worked at Sylvia’s on and off for years to come.  Romances were also a part of Sylvia’s – waitresses and soda fountain men, customers and of course high school sweethearts.   There were three shifts – the morning crew, the day crew and the night crew worked until 11:00 so that the movie crowd could come in for a snack after the movie.  If you were a “soda jerk” you worked at the end of the counter, pouring Cokes from the red coke machine or making milk shakes, frappes or ice creams sundaes.   Only the more expert counter men worked the sandwich counter.  The waitresses all wore uniforms with those pretty handkerchiefs in their pockets.  \n\nI also remember the Christmas Holiday Season and the Easter season when everyone from Brockton and the surrounding towns came downtown to shop.  We didn’t see much of my dad in those busy times when he often worked 16 hours a day.   He went to work in a suit and tie, with an overcoat and hat, changed his clothes in his “office” always wearing a tie and a white long sleeve shirt with a white bib apron.    I also remember a lovely little lady who was the bookkeeper.  She would come once a week to do the payroll and pay the bills.  Downstairs was the office, the ice cream making machine and the kitchen with the dumb waiter to send up the food.     \n\nMy parents, along with countless people who have wonderful memories of Brockton would be so proud to know that downtown Brockton at the corner of School and Main Street and Sylvia Sweets Tea Room was used as an example of a “street in an industrial town in Massachusetts.”  \nElaine (Dayos) Liatsos  8/2008","Thanks for this beautiful account of your family's restaurant.

I also have many fond memories of Sylvia Sweets. Brockton was once a fine place to spend time downtown. I too remember the Rocky MArciano parade. What a kick. This made my day!","I don't usually post on the internet, but the picture and the stories from BHS classmates rekindled cherished memories of Sylvia Sweets and downtown Brockton back in the fifties. Sylvia Sweets was a Brockton institution enjoyed by many generations of Brocktonians. I recall so many times what a special trip it was to take the bus downtown to go shopping at Besse Bakers or Edgars or Kreseges or to take in a movie at one of the theaters. Sylvia Sweets was always the place to stop before heading home. If you want to see more pictures of Brockton as it was back when we were in school, check out the Stanley Baumann photo collection at Stonehill College. It's on Facebook and you may even find yourself in one of the pictures. Stanley Baumann alway seemed to be everywhere with a camera. As this wonderful picture of Sylvia Sweets did, his old pictures also bring back great memories of what a great city we lived in for a time. Denis Gillen BHS class of 56","There is a nostalgia that comes over one looking at old photographs.  Looking at the rare color photo from the 1940's of Sylvia Sweet's Tea Room in Brockton, MA puts a longing in the soul.  It's like there is a yearning for the ability for those doors to be open again and be able to walk through and enjoy a fried clam dinner for only .40cents.  So at today's prices that would be more like $6-$10 but it would be nice. An interest in a time that seemed simpler.  The place looks like it was full of many delicious meals and from the posts I perused after the pictures were posted, this was confirmed.  Many people have enjoyed many good memories there and the color photo was amazing at drawing those memories out to the light of conversation after such a long time in remission.  I looked at the photo of the same corner today on Google map full of traffic passing through.  A couple of people standing on another corner taking an outdoor break.  The opposite corner has a computer repair shop.  Looking at that corner made me wish for Sylvia Sweets to be there again.  That corner in that town looks like it needs something like Sylvia Sweets there again bringing activity, good food, good company and a sense of community back to that corner again.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Sylvia Sweets could be brought back from the tomes of history and the 1940's to the year 2013 or 2014?","love diners!","thanks for sharing this","looks like a steam engine","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1356957@N22/\">The Sub-Sub-Basement</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","I always imagined these houses in color, when I see them in old photos..\r\nbut man they were painted gray! how depressing.

Though mayhaps for different reasons. When this picture was taken money was tight so used was an option. Then the U.S. went through a period where new was the only way to go, only the 'disadvantaged' bought used. Used clothes, used materials, and so on. (Of course this does not include the antiques and collectibles).\r\n\r\nAbout a decade ago the used market really took off and became mainstream. I seem to remember This Old House shopping in junkyards.\r\n\r\nRound it goes ...","Is '1914' a tag that really makes sense for this photo? The only connection between the date and the photo is that the photographer happened to be born in 1914, which isn't really relevant to the photo or the subject. If I was searching for &quot;1914&quot; I would be looking for photos taken in 1914, or having some connection to things that happened in 1914. Popping up a bunch of results with the only connection being the birthdate of the author of the work would be annoying, to say the least.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/657143@N23/\">The Original Plymouth Colony</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","&quot;We cut and thread pipes while your waiting&quot;\nAt least the Internet isn't responsible for bad grammar ;)","very good idea to make '30-40 in color","I think this building still exists.

This was the old junky hardware store on Pleasant St.  Don't know if it's still there but it was, and looked more or less like the photo, until at least the late '80s -- just had fewer fixtures strewn about the yard, and that cool paint color had warn off.  I remember it being more of a dirty warn gray color all over, like shown in upper story.","I believe this building was located on the corner of N. Montello Street and Porter Pass. If you zoom in on the front window you can see the reflection of a sign across the street that appears to be the Woodward's Auto Spring Company that was (and still is) in business in 1940. Also there is a title transfer record indicating that Peter Saba sold a lot at this same location to the Tilo Roofing company in 1946.","When this photo was taken, Saba and others like this still had a lot of inventory because we were coming out of the worse decade in history, the Depression.  During that period, nothing was thrown away or discarded, it was used and reused and many considered themselves lucky to get it reused for a third time.  WWII brought the final close to the Depression.  Those of us that are direct descendants of that time, still in old age, tend to save things.","Does anyone have more infor or other pictures of this building.?

And documenting the condition of American farmland.  \nNotice in these photos how the vegetation is very sparce.  That is because the topsoil has been eroded away after a hundred years of neglecting the soil.  Up until the late 1930's many farmers simply removed the trees from the forrests and planted crops on the naturally rich soil.  After a few years the natural nutrients were depleted and crops wouldn't grow so the farmer moved to &quot;new ground&quot; and left the old fields.   Since there wasn't enough nutrients in the soil to support plants, the soils eroded.\nDuring and after WWII fertilizers became more affordable and farmers started practicing better farming techniques.","It looks to me like these photos might have been taken in the southern pinelands, which can have sandy soil and support the type of flora you see pictured.","I love this backdrop and scenery, it very much reminds me of some places I have been in Australia. Amazing clarity and beauty for such an old slide, wow.","Looks to be a buzzard the top of the chimney","Notice the soil, the crops are rocks and weeds and that's about all that would grow after a couple of centuries of cotton monoculture.  The United States Government bought land like this throughout the South in the thirties and early forties (before our entry into WWII) for four to five dollars per acre (my research says it was not &quot;four to five&quot; but rather four OR five,)  The sellers, in most cases were very happy with the deal and many moved on to a better life elsewhere.  Much of the land purchased in Georgia under the auspices of Piedmont Plantation Project has since become Oconee National Forest, but when it was purchased it was all as barren as the land in this picture.  Thanks to Franklin Delano Roosevelt for both the thriving and verdant National Forest in Putnam, Jasper, Oconee, Jones, Morgan, counties and for the beautiful pictures in this collection.","so why are these slides photographed with the sinar, rather than scanned? They look like they could all do with some saturation.\r\nI know they're old photos, but imagine what could be done to remember the time and how colorful it truly was","Is that a chicken on the roof?","atdakore \r\n\r\nPossibly because a 'slide duplicator' is the native format of slides. Light is suppose to go through a slide once, not through the slide to be reflected back through the slide THEN recorded.\r\n\r\nAlso, for a slide to be scanned it needs removed from the slide holder. I know these slides LOOK as though they have been removed from their card but that is something we can not be sure of unless we see cog holes. \r\n\r\nAlso a slide duplicator allows the photographing of film left in strips, or that have been mounted in cards, or unmounted single frames.\r\n\r\nI have downloaded numerous TIFFs and I am impressed at the clarity and sharpness.\r\n\r\nAlso, ALL these slides need doctored? ALL need more 'saturation'? That makes me want to laugh! Hate to tell you but not everything is colorful. Not all grass is Kelly Green. Or mayhaps your monitor needs calibrated.\r\n\r\nI've looked throught he first 89 pages of this archive and I have to say that overall I have been reminded of the fullness and richness of transparency films.","Looks like a turkey buzzard on the roof.

The pictures focus on rural areas and farm labor, as well as aspects of World War II mobilization, including factories, railroads, aviation training, and women working.\n\nThe original images are color transparencies ranging in size from 35 mm. to 4x5 inches.

See all the utility poles?  Of course not, there was no electricity, no telephone, no connection with the outside world.  I lived there (Southern Appalachia) from the mid sixties until 1980.  Even then, there were pockets -- communities that were as isolated as they had been since the Cherokee Removal (Trail of Tears).  That is to say, they had no passable roads, mules were as common as jalopies (or moonshiner's hot rods) where electricity was available it was so new that the people only thought to hang a bare light bulb from the ceiling,  No telephones, and while broadcast television was possible, it took a mighty antenna to get a snowy image from Atlanta or Greenville SC. (and nobody could afford either the TV set or the antenna anyway)  For my personal experience of &quot;impoverishment,&quot; I lived without electricity, telephone, etc from 1975 to 1980, not so much because it wasn't available, but because I could not afford it.  My family (wife and two kids) and I recall that period as a time of great richness.  We would lie in reclining lawn chairs, sometimes bundled in sleeping bags and observe the stars, or we would hike in the woods, sometimes for extended trips of three to five days, learning about trees, flowers, butterflies, etc.  Today we all live in the 21st century with a TV set the size of a barn door, a car that goes 90, THE INTERNET, air conditioning, etc.  Am I richer than I was then?

Barrage balloons are an anti aircraft device mostly used in WWII. It's not a Zeppelin and it has nothing to do with a Zeppelin!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1040735@N24/\">Kcity</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Barage balloons were tethered over military targets, usually in clusters. The cables that tethered them could sever the wings or severely damage attacking planes and/or disrupt the trajectory of falling bombs. They gained popularity when aerial bombing was in its infancy so pilots had to fly below the level of the balloon for reasonable accuracy. Planes at that time were made of canvas stretched over wood frames.\n\nRelatively few barage balloons were used by the end of WWII because aerial bombing had become a science and targets could be accurately bombed from far above the barage balloon.\n\nThe image is dark because color slide/transparency film is very sensitive to exposure setting (shutter speed and lens aperture setting) Light meters were separate from cameras and frequently photographers relied on &quot;standard&quot; settings that worked for most situations. That means that frequently the exposure setting was close enough, but not perfect.","In WW II barrage baloons were valuable as a defense during troop landings - Normandy, etc. when you could prevent hit and run straffing of your troops bunched up on beaches and roads - the baloons were emplaced at right angles to where the planes would need to take their runs... The cables easily cut plane bodies and metal wings, or tossed them out of control, etc, when hit at 300+ mph","This just reminds me of Dr. Who","One of the tags says, &quot;I think they were to fake out enemy pilots or cause some sort of disruption in line of sight.&quot; Another says, &quot;This whole blimp is probably filled with hydrogen. These blimps were considered death traps because the hydrogen would spontaneously combust sometimes.&quot; They weren't blimps, and though filled with hydrogen, they weren't &quot;death traps&quot; because they were unmanned. They were &quot;aerostats,&quot; meaning essentially tethered balloons. Their purpose wasn't  &quot;to fake out enemy pilots or cause some sort of disruption in line of sight&quot;; in fact, the cable to which they were attached was the purpose: the idea was that when a lot of these balloons were tethered around what might be a bombing target--a harbor, a city, or an industrial complex--the cables would prevent low-flying aircraft, which weren't susceptible to antiaircraft fire, from getting through. Forced to fly higher, the planes could more easily be targeted by ack-ack fire. Hence the chief purpose they served was deterrence.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mayanaut] \nIf this blimp is American, it probably doesn't have any hydrogen in it!! That goes doubly so if it's a military craft. \nThe primary use of helium in the 1940's was as a lifting gas. It was rare, but the United States started large scale production of helium in 1921 for the US Navy. In 1925, Congress passed the Helium Act, creating a helium reserve and other measures to ensure the availability of helium for military and research purposes. A good deal of tension leading up to WWII was caused by the United States not wanting to share their recipe for helium with other countries. Helium was rare, but the US government took measures to make sure they had it.","Lots of good information in the discussion of barrage balloons here.  I just wanted to point out a series of photographs available in our online catalog: <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/</a> under the the keyword &quot;barrage balloons&quot; with details of their manufacture and use.  One photo caption notes that the balloon will be filled with &quot;helium in service.&quot;","Please, everyone, if you are GUESSING at what the picture is about, then don't say anything. Almost every comment here that is trying to correct what someone else has said about the subject is WRONG. A few got some of the details right, but they didn't stop with what they had a reasonable knowledge about, they went on to guess at other things. The barrage balloons were filled with helium, not hydrogen. They were used to deter low-flying aircraft and were used in groups around important military and industrial targets. They were NOT used to defend ships at sea, a very popular misconception. The photos of ships with barrage balloons flying above them were merely transporting the balloons for use on an invasion beach or inland. By having the balloons already inflated, it saved considerable time in making them operational once they reached land. The balloons shown flying above ships are too low to be effective against ANY aircraft. And flying them higher, because of the motion of the ships, puts too much strain on the steel cables, which could cause them to snap, thus not only losing the balloon, but the snapped cable could injure or kill men on the ships. Most barrage balloons were transported uninflated along with the equipment needed to inflate, raise them and secure them. The balloons had to be periodically lowered, more helium added, and then raised again. They were not used to &quot;deflect bombs.&quot; (Seriously?!) They were not used to fake out pilots or cause disruption of line of sight (you're confusing the balloons with camouflage). Also, you can't have anti-aircraft weapons and barrage balloons in the same vicinity - the guns could inadvertently destroy the balloons. The two are dispersed in rings around a potential target so that each can do its job without being impeded by the other. And the balloons could not be &quot;placed at right angles&quot; on the landing beaches. The balloons could not be &quot;aimed&quot; in a certain direction. It wasn't the balloons themselves that planes were afraid of (which could be easily seen by the pilots and aircrews) - it was the cable beneath the balloon which could damage or destroy an aircraft when hit. The balloons were even used during the defense of London against the V1 flying bombs - at least one was brought down by a balloon. How do I know all this? Because I published a book, &quot;The U.S. Army Barrage Balloon Program&quot; by James Shock, the current 4th edition was released in 2006 (first published in 1997) and is still available from my company, Merriam Press, you can view sample pages at GoogleBooks. Shock received the 2010 Lifetime Achievement Award from The Lighter-Than-Air Society, having researched, studied and written about all types of LTA topics since high school and served in the US Army during WWII. Google the book's title and you'll see a number of web sites/pages that reference the book and/or the author. The book is a revised and expanded version of his article that appeared in the Spring 1989 issue of the AAHS (American Aviation Historical Society) Journal. The book is still available new from Merriam Press; currently it is not in distribution and so is not available from Amazon or other online booksellers at this time (I'm working on putting it into the distribution system, but that takes time and money); as I write this someone is offering a copy on Amazon for almost twice the retail price of the paperback.","Cool<img src=\"http://s04.flagcounter.com/map/rzN/size=t/txt=FFFFFF/border=FFFFFF/pageviews=0/viewers=3/\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://s04.flagcounter.com/count/rzN/bg=ffffff/txt=ffffff/border=ffffff/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=0/labels=0/.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://2.s04.flagcounter.com/count/rzN/bg=ffffff/txt=ffffff/border=ffffff/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=0/labels=0/.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/26467189@N05] \n\nBINGO!

The exposure is a compromise one, to get both sky and land, true, but those old-time photographers knew what they were doing, and so the detail is indeed on the transparency, waiting to be revealed.

She's very jealous.","It looks as if they're a bit overwhelmed at all the things to see!\r\nMy mother told me that back then they would buy their flour in large sacks.  These sacks were made of colorful fabric.

I am also going to guess that this mother might be pregnant with another baby, judging from the way she is holding the little girl in blue.  I love the homemade matching dresses.  I wonder if they are from feedsacks, as Hippie Gal said, or if Mom splurged on a bolt of fabric to make these?","The boy is probably lucky his shirt wasn't made from the same fabric!","Great color!  I saw the girls' matching dresses and guessed that Mom bought a bolt of the fabric and made all their dresses from it.  I had no clue that flour sacks came in bright colors and could be re-used!  I'd have to see that.","Chances are those dresses were hand made from the same bolt of cloth.","Look at the gentleman with the hat. He is serious.","I can imagine they each have a few pennies or a nickel and are deciding where or what to spend them on.

Perhaps that's why mom and the girls are all looking in different directions?  Hoping to catch a glimpse of which way the <i>facilities</i> might be?   Hmmm... I'm looking at the pic as if the scene is happening in present time.  Isn't it amazing how a good photo can transport us right into the time and space the participants were experiencing??  It's such a treat that the L.O.C. has made these old treasures available to us here!","It looks like there is so much commotion at the state fair, that everybody is looking at something different!

I remember there were patterns that called for 5 sacks or whatever.  I was quite young but I had feed sack dresses and curtains.  There are now reproductions of those fabrics that quilters are very fond of and believe me are pricey.  Check out ebay once for them.","I wish Flickr would disable Notes for all photos. Would you scribble all over this photo if you saw it hanging on the wall at the LoC?","@madmonk - Notes don't negatively affect the images, nor permanently alter them. Keep your mouse away from the image and the note-boxes go away. Or, view the full size of the photo and again, there are no notes. As well, notes <i>do</i> add accessibility/usability to photos - by attaching more tags/terms to images that help photos show up when a user does a search.","So cool yet so strange to see these in color...it gave me chills.","The kids in this photograph would be in their 70's right now.","I can tell you this! Vermonters no longer have such large families, It would have been nice to have seen so much light and so many children have this much fun in colorful setting when I lived there.

Where George Clooney's 'kids' are all dressed alike and they are all girls.  My mom knitted and made my clothes in the early-mid 70s still. It was still common for Mom's to make their kid's clothes even up till the 70s until mass marketing of everything in the 80s came along. Along with Fast food and obsesity and hormones in all our food products...ughhhh!","Even looking at these precious photos of someone else's family make's you realize how valuable they are!! Life goes by very fast!!! Please don't throw family albums away!!! If you do not want them give them to a relative that does!!! Document in them who these people are. They are neither rich or famous but are &quot;America&quot;!!!!

Some are of relatives we don't know. But they are treasured. You can never have too many photos of your ancestors' lives.","I guess the boy has to be lucky that his mum didn't make him a pair of shorts from the same material, I guess he could have put up with a shirt in that colour.\nThe little boots on the baby might have been hand me downs from the boy having said that it could be a boy wearing one of the girls hand me downs?","Could be floursack dresses.

Slides were fairly large format (at least 2 1/4&quot; square from memory possibly even larger I am sure someone out there can correct me) and the grain as such minimal. it would take a professional level digital camera today to reach the same level of resolution as those old slides.","They are amazing photographs, and this is definitely a favorite!   The original images are color transparencies (film, not glass), ranging in size from 35 mm Kodachrome slides  to 4 x  5 inch transparencies.  Kodachrome in particular has extremely good longevity when stored properly, and this collection of film has been in good storage conditions most of its life.

I agree that she probably is not of 100% African extraction (few are), but I am sure that through her entire life she was identified by both others and herself as &quot;black&quot;.  I see no insult in referring to her as such, unless one believes there is something inherently bad about being black, a premise I am unwilling to concede.","I don't care what color she is ... she rocks!

(Black is the only racial category to which this 'one-drop rule' applies, by the way.)\r\n\r\nAnd she appears lighter in the other photo thanks to bad makeup. There weren't many options available to black women back then, and the few available tended towards the chalky or the reddish.","@coming_again - to add to the excellent comments of @tiffanybbrown - please read the book, The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man by James Weldon Johnson and also The Human Stain by Phillip Roth.
