Blaine denied the charges, as did the Union Pacific's directors. Blaine claimed he never had any dealings with the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad except to purchase bonds at market price, and that he had lost money on the transaction. Democrats in the House of Representatives nevertheless demanded a Congressional investigation. The testimony appeared to favor Blaine's version of events until May 31, when James Mulligan, a Boston clerk formerly employed by Blaine's brother-in-law, testified that the allegations were true, that he had arranged the transaction, and that he had letters to prove it. The letters ended with the damning phrase, &quot;Kindly burn this letter.&quot; When the investigating committee recessed, Blaine met with Mulligan in his hotel room; what transpired between the men is unknown, but Blaine left with the letters and refused to turn them over to the committee.&quot;\n\nPlus ça change!","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling</a>","Penny farthing","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing</a>\n&quot;About 1870, English inventor James Starley, described as the father of the bicycle industry, and others began producing bicycles based on the French boneshaker but with front wheels of increasing size, because larger front wheels, up to 1.5 m (60 in) in diameter, enabled higher speeds on bicycles limited to direct drive.

Hankow, China, today was in the hands of a revolutionary mob, and great quantities of property were being burned, according to cable advices received here by the Robert Dollar Steamship Company from its Hankow office. No details were received. The Dollar Company's advices said that the .premises adjoining their lumber and shipping yards in Hankow were in flames, but that their holdings were not endangered. The steamship company officials took this to indicate that the German concessions and a portion of the native residence section were burning, as they adjoin the Dollar property. Hankow is a city of 1.250,000 population, in the Province of Hupeh. Large foreign holdings are situated near the Dollar property. \n\nRevolutionary attempt was directed by the leaders of the Kuo-Ming-Tang, the radical revolutionary party of China, against the military Governor Tuchun Wang.

Before that, mourners had assembled at the Molloy Funeral Home. One can only imagine the\nstories about Kay that her friends and admirers shared. An obituary in the June 27 newspaper, The Hartford Times,\ncommented that she had led “an unusually colorful life.” Those who gathered undoubtedly knew that she was a fearless\nNavy nurse in World War I, a model for a famous war poster, a soprano who sang at New York’s Metropolitan Opera,\nan entertainer, and in Hartford, a dance instructor and talent agency director.\nWe know little about her family except that at the\ntime of her death, her father, Richard Day Kay, a\nretired jeweler, lived in Hartford. Obituaries\nmentioned that she was from Detroit. A press\nrelease in 1922 stated that she was a “former\nDetroit Society Girl. When she was young, she\nand many other countrywomen launched\nthemselves into the first industrial supplied war,\nso vast and destructive that people referred to it\nas the “Great War.” Both the Navy and Army\nhad created auxiliary nurses corps before the\nnation had entered the war. Kay joined the Naval\nNurse Corps and at the age of 17 achieved the\nrank of Yeoman First Class. Yeoman Kay served\non the Western Front from May to September,\n1916, first at an American Ambulance Hospital\nat Nevilly – sur – Seine, France and thereafter in\nbase hospitals with Mrs. William K. Vanderbuilt.\nThere were two stories about her bravery. The\nfirst contended that she was one of the first\nAmerican women to drive an ambulance behind\nenemy lines to pick up wounded. Another said\nthat she was the first woman on the Western Front\nto fly across enemy lines, most likely with other\nmedics. In the folder about her in the State\nArchives, there is a photograph of her assisting a\ndoctor in an operation and a medal showing a\nnurse giving aid to a fallen soldier.\nAnother story relates that when she returned\nstateside, she was chosen as the model for a Red Cross fund raising poster. She was dressed in nurse’s garb and her\nhands and arms were outstretched. The only word on the poster was “Give.” She was proud of it, and kept a copy of\nthe poster on the walls of her apartment that her third husband and she shared on Mulberry St. in Hartford.\ncontinued\nFrom the State Archives: Yeoman Third Class Marjorie Kay\nMark H. Jones, State Archivist\nPortrait of Marjorie Kay as Red Cross NurseVolume 5 Number 2 PAGE 5 The CONNector The CONNector\nShe became a dancer and studied as coloratura soprano. Friends stated that she had sung with Enrico Caruso at the\nMet. By the mid – 1920’s, she settled in Hartford, that had been a stop along the Keith – Albee Circuit. She opened\na dancing school and later directed a successful talent agency. The Hartford Times noted that she was “one of\nHartford’s best known entertainers.” The Courant observed that on the walls of the apartment that her husband and she\nshared hung “pictures of Miss Kay in costume taken when she was on the stage.”\nThe Times emphasized her beauty: “Tall, stately, slim and blond, Miss Kay never lost the beauty that helped bring her\nsuccess in the entertainment field.”\nShe received a life - long pension from the Federal government for her military service. Among keepsakes from the war, she kept a belt to which were attached “fifty four buttons, collar ornaments, shoulder badges, hat badges and Belt Buckles” from Allied armies and even those of Germany and Austria. Unfortunately we do not know the fate of her\ncopy of the Red Cross poster or the decorative World War I belt.\nThe file on her comes from the War Records Department that operated in the State Library from 1917 to the 1950’s.\nA man from Florida, one of her two former husband’s or a close supporter, mailed the contents to the State Library in\n1952.

He began with classes in the public schools; now the New York Community Chorus has the use of the great hall of the City College. Last winter the Chorus numbering eighteen hundred gave Handel's Messiah in Madison Square Garden before an audience of ten thousand.  Last June it gave Haydn's Creation in the Hippodrome before another vast audience.  The current week it gives a great open air Song and Light Festival at night in Central Park.  A thousand children will participate in this festival accompanied by a thousand adults and two thousand soldiers and scores of thousands of volunteers.  For Mr Barnhart has the faculty of making people sing who did not know they possessed the power of singing. He makes soldiers sing,  he makes baseball fans sing,  he can make any crowd join in and thoroughly enjoy a song.&quot;\nThe Outlook, 1917\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=f5_PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Harry+Barnhart,+the+leader+of+the+New+York+Community+Chorus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gHMT1O5CJ3&amp;sig=1x8Gjmpn1-g0TEdnjp1W-lxJxZU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6RbwU6-OM5LioATh-4HoCg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Harry%20Barnhart&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=f5_PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lp...</a>","Another source describes him as Harry H.

He made a feature of getting\nthe onlookers to join in the chorus of\nhis songs. Finding that everybody  \nwished to sing, and could sing, under\nproper encouragement and leadership,\nhe set out to develop the idea. With\nthe leave of the Mayor he appeared with\ntho Municipal Band in the Convention\nHall, and asked the audience to sing.\nThey responded enthusiastically. Thus\nwas formed the first community chorus.\nThe idea spread to other centres, and in\n1914 many of the community singers\nmet at a great festival at Rochester,\nforming a trained chorus of 1,500 sing-\ners. The American composer, Arthur\nFarwell, became deeply interested in\ntho movement, and Induced Mr. Barn-\nhart to visit New York once a week\nto conduct a community chorus. Dur-\ning this time Claude Bragdon, an archi-\ntect and author living at Rochester, saw\nthe possibilities of combining light and\ncolour with outdoor singing. Crowds\nup to 15,000 gathered in a public park,\nand were led by a trained community\nsinging group. This became known as\n&quot;song and light.&quot; In New York a\ngreat chorus was trained which gave\nHandel's &quot;Messiah&quot; in Madison Square\nGarden, and three yearly &quot;song and light\nfestivals&quot; in Central Park, with 100,000\npersons singing antiphonally across the\nlake at night time. &quot;\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/29922848#pstart1812626\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/29922848#pstart1812626</a>","Thanks to both of you for catching the typo and providing the additional information.

He came from a musical family, his father Maurice Penha also being a musician. Penha graduated from the Amsterdam Conservatoire in 1905, at age 16 165.  He had studied with Isaac Mossel (1870-1923).   Penha also studied with Hugo Becker (1864-1941), perhaps at Dr. Hoch’s Konservatorium in Frankfurt.  Michel Penha made his first concert appearance in Amsterdam in 1907 and then toured Europe.  He relocated to New York in 1909.  From 1909-1918, Michel Penha was active in New York City as part of the Tollefsen Piano Trio 167, led by Carl Tollefsen, at that time first violin of the New York Symphony.  Michel Penha also formed the Penha Trio, based in New York City.  Penha also performed chamber music recitals in New York.  In 1915-1916, Penha toured South America with Chilean composer and pianist Alberto Guerrero (1886-1959) including in Bolivia, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, and Cuba.  In the 1920-1921 season, Michel Penha was appointed Principal cello of the Philadelphia Orchestra by Leopold Stokowski.  Penha was Principal cello for five seasons, beginning in 1920, the same season in which Romain Verney joined the Philadelphia Orchestra as Principal viola.   Also like his friend Verney, Michel Penha left the Philadelphia Orchestra at the end of the 1924-1925 season to relocate to San Francisco.   Michel Penha become Principal cello of the San Francisco Symphony appointed by Alfred Hertz in the 1925-1926 season.  In the late 1920s, Penha and Verney were together members of two string quartets, chamber music groups forming an important part of Penha's career.  These were the California String Quartet: Robert Pollack first, William Wolski second, Romain Verney viola, and Michel Penha cello, which continued into the 1940s.  The other was the Abas String Quartet, with Nathan Abas first, Hubert Sorenson (1910-1971) second, Abraham Weiss viola and (for at least part of the time) Michel Penha cello.  In 1938, Michel Penha was a member of the San Francisco String Quartet, founded by SFS Concertmaster Naoum Blinder: Naoum Blinder first, William Wolski second, Romain Verney viola, and Michel Penha cello.  Penha in 1930 relocated to Portland, Oregon for a time, although still active in the San Francisco area.  In Oregon, he played in the Neah–Kah–Nie String Quartet: Susie Fennell Pipes first, Hubert Sorenson second, Alexander Vdovin viola and Michel Penha cello.  In 1951 in California, Penha joined the Roussel Trio of Doriot Anthony (later Dwyer) flute, Harry Rumpler viola, and Michel Penha cello, based in Los Angeles.  Penha was also active as a Hollywood studio musician at the MGM Studios166.

These governments, however, sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies.\nThese tractors also provided members of the British army with the inspiration needed to design the tank. Colonel E. D. Swinton had seen Holt's Caterpillar tractors in action and borrowed their track-laying principle to provide the tank with its form of locomotion.\nAfter the U.S. declaration of war, Holt placed its facilities at the disposal of the government. The Holt Manufacturing Company had advantages over other tractor companies due to the relationship it had developed with the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. In fact, bids from the Ordnance department called for specifications of the &quot;Caterpillar type.&quot; Holt expanded factories to accommodate production of the large numbers of tractors the government required.

However, Pratt, an advocate of education, wanted to provide the opportunity for working men and women to better their lives through education. Even though Pratt never had the opportunity to go to college himself, he wanted to create an affordable college accessible to the working class. In 1884 Pratt began purchasing parcels of land in his affluent home town of Clinton Hill for the intention of opening a school.

Leading each country's respective delegations were Franklin K. Lane, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, and Luis Cabrera, an important advisor to Carranza. Other representatives from both governments represented the various parties. The Commission issued a statement on December 24, 1916 which stated that U.S. troops could remain in Mexico if their presence was necessary, but otherwise should withdraw. Carranza rejected the agreement, sensing that it allowed for an indefinite U.S. presence. However, the talks sufficed to ease tensions and the U.S. troops prepared for withdrawal and re-crossed the border on February 5, 1917.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/wwi/108653.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/wwi/108653.htm</a>","and see notes under <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/14730107633\" title=\"Arredondo (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/14730107633_956f65bdb1.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" alt=\"Arredondo (LOC)\" /></a>","Thanks for this great research artolog.

J.P. Allen writes in the New York Evening Post:\n&quot;Mikami and Kumagae played considerably in the championships of the Orient at Manila in singles and doubles before they ventured to the United States. At Manila they had met and competed against many of the Americans, chiefly from California, such as Maurice E. McLoughlin, Melville H. Long, Carlton R. Gardner, Clarence J. Griffin and others.  Edwin Gee the leading figure in the lawn tennis world of Manila believed that the two Japanese would add to their laurels by visiting the United States. He prevailed upon them to make the trip in 1916. [...]\nThe playing of the two, Mikami and Kumagae, furnished one of the features of the season of 1916.  Coming to this country direct from Japan, they first competed in tournaments on Pacific coast. Then they journeyed eastward on the way in the sectional doubles at St Louis.  It was there that they began to display their real form which became interesting as Kumagae began to bowl over some of the stars in singles in matches later on in the East.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=5LI5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA120&amp;dq=mikami+tennis+1916&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QLXNU97YEcPqoASpnYH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=mikami%20tennis%201916&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=5LI5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA120&a...</a>\n\nSome Mikami photos elsewhere online from LOC:\n<a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/S?ammem/cdn:@field\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/S?ammem/cdn:@field</a>(SUBJ+@od1(Mikami,+Hachishiro+))","Art Siegel:  Thanks for the information about Mikami.

At the turn of the century, Girard was home to two major whiskey warehouses, shipping their stock throughout the Southeast and as far away as New York and Boston. But the whiskey interests met increasing political opposition from prohibitionists, who by 1909 were in the forefront of a move to dry up Alabama. In 1914 they gained control of the legislature, and soon afterward they passed a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol. For Girard and Russell County businessmen, this meant ignoring the law or losing everything they had.\n\nThey chose the former. Aware of the tremendous unpopularity of the law, local officials reached an unspoken agreement with the whiskey interests. Russell County grand juries routinely indicted violators, who would then pay bond. When the accused failed to show for trial, the county would pocket the forfeited surety. It seemed like a reasonable arrangement, but technically it qualified as political corruption. Whatever it was called, it was the beginning of a long history of selective law enforcement in Girard and Russell County.\n\nUnfortunately for the Russell County distributors, local option was not an option. By the summer of 1916, prohibitionist groups were demanding state intervention in east Alabama, and the first great Russell County cleanup was under way. At the direction of the Alabama Supreme Court, Circuit Judge A. H. Alston of Clayton and the state attorney general, Logan Martin, went to Seale, the county seat since 1868, and took over the local judiciary. On August 8, Alston impaneled a new grand jury and instructed it to destroy &quot;for once and all time&quot; lawlessness in Russell County and to investigate collusion between bootleggers and local officials.\n\nThe resulting court proceedings were swift, merciless, and judicially questionable. Those indicted were brought to trial as soon as the grand jury voted a true bill, usually less than three hours. After the first two indictees received a hefty $2,500 fine, many of the others fled, hoping for a better day to appear before the bar. Alston declared them fugitives and confiscated their holdings.\n\nState militia entered Girard on August 10 and began hauling out bottles, kegs, and casks from the warehouses and anywhere else they could be found; these they assembled at the intersection of Seale Road and Broad Street. All day long, militiamen, special deputy sheriffs, and hired laborers destroyed some eight hundred casks of beer and an equal number of barrels of whiskey. Some workers fainted from the fumes, which could be smelled in eastern Columbus, two miles away. Eventually, more than a quarter of a million dollars' worth of illegal alcohol was destroyed during the cleanup, and several prominent citizens were ruined in the process. And as a result of the grand jury's investigation into political corruption, almost every city and county official resigned his office.&quot;\n\nThe 1916 cleanup might have been longer lived had it not been for the establishment two years later of Fort Benning, the U.S. Army infantry-training school just outside Columbus. Even as the recruits were moving into the tents and thrown-together buildings, bootleg liquor was again flowing freely in Girard. Arriving doughboys quickly learned that a good time could be found on the Alabama side and crossed the Chattahoochee in droves. By the time the Roaring Twenties arrived, Martin's cleanup had completely unraveled and Girard was once again living down to its reputation.","<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/14441065227\" title=\"River of whiskey, Girard, Ala.

Most Union volunteers in California stayed in California, relieving Federal units to return to the main fighting in the east.  But some volunteers (true believers in the cause or those with a thirst for action) went out of their way to join a unit that would be directly involved in the action in the east.  They put their enlistment bonus money towards steamer fare (via Panama) to Boston and there they became units of the 2nd Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry.  I can't make out the company letter below the crossed sabres on his Forage cap. Might be a &quot;B&quot;?  More images of soldiers from the California Battalion are <a href=\"http://www.2mass.reunioncivilwar.com/images/Battalion.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, including a couple that look like they were taken in the same studio.\n\nSecond, I don't think this is an ambrotype.  The image does not appear to be reversed as one might expect in an ambrotype.  The lettering on the cap is legible.  While it might have been a prop cap with reversed lettering, I doubt it.  Other photos from the same setting have similar, but not identical caps, and they too are legible.  Also the buttons on the soldier's tunic are properly aligned with the piping (piping to the left of the buttons). Compare that to the buttons on all the other ambrotypes in this batch.  Rather I think this is a <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/the-cartes-de-visite-craze/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carte de visite</a> (CDV).  That might also explain why the original is less sharp than some of the other ambrotypes.","Thanks for the information and the question.

Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). &quot;","swanq:How interesting!

The Britton of the Seventh scenes feature an easily identifiable Custer and soldiers in civil war era uniforms with antique long rifles (not exaclty historically accurate, but . . . )\n\nMy guess is that Lionel Belmore directed most of Britton in studio in Brooklyn.  I'd guess that most of Battle Cry was filmed in Brooklyn as well by . . . whoever. But since the studio was going on location to film big sweeping battle scenes for Battle Cry ( a big 9-reel feature) they probably tucked in a half day of filming a flashback scene of Custer's Last Stand to drop into Britton (a 4-reel melodrama.)","Same area with horseman and guy with megaphone, different angle:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/14463154331\" title=\"Vitagraph gun (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14463154331_8aa337afef.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"360\" alt=\"Vitagraph gun (LOC)\" /></a> and see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/14279917288\" title=\"Gun for Vitagraph battle scene (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2904/14279917288_6ee3ca2dc3.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"359\" alt=\"Gun for Vitagraph battle scene (LOC)\" /></a>","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/90124154@N00] The idea that there are two separate films being shot is an interesting one.

There is reason to doubt that this Vitagraph series is from the filming of either &quot;Battle Cry of Peace&quot; or &quot;Britton of the Seventh&quot;.  From the accounts of the plot of BCOP,  I didn't find any that described trench warfare and heavy artillery.  Instead there was a lot about attacks from the air and sea on New York City.  BCOP was also released in 1915, and BOT7th in January, 1916, making their filming a year before the current August/September 1916 spot in the Bain news stream.\n&quot;Battle Cry  of War&quot; appears to have been a working title for &quot;Womanhood, Glory of a Nation,&quot; released in 1917.  It was also one of the later titles of a re-edited &quot;Battle Cry of Peace.&quot;  The idea that the Custer scene is part of a flashback in Womanhood is worth pursuing.","I'm sticking with <i>Battle Cry of Peace</i> for these artillery/trench scenes.  The <i><a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~gdegroat/NT/oldreviews/bcop.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Variety</a></i>  review specifically refers to the &quot;enemy fleet&quot; being out of range of US coast defense guns.

I have to wonder if the title of the 1917 <i>Womanhood: Glory of a Nation</i> was a deliberate play on Griffith's 1915 <i>Birth of a Nation</i>.

A modern reviewer seems to have seen it: &quot;What's more fascinating than the plot is the multitude of mistakes made by director Lionel Belmore and Vitagraph's production staff in recreating 1876. For example, Rain-in-the-Face (Logan Paul) uses a repeating rifle to shoot down a couple of scouts (those guns didn't exist back then), and Britton is shown wearing a modern (circa 1916) suit and collar. Such errors were especially fatal in an era where people were still alive who remembered the times of Custer first hand. It makes you wonder why the studio -- trying for accuracy -- bothered to shoot the film in Texas with the help of the Seventh U.S. Cavalry. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/86022/Britton-of-the-Seventh/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/86022/Britton-of-the-Seventh...</a>","Definitely not Britton of the Seventh.

The third of five St. Paul's brothers, he was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, December 14, 1888, the son of Charles O. and Mary Bliss Read, and entered the School in the Fourth Form in 1903. He was a natural athlete. &quot;Strenuous in games and very strong,&quot; M. K. Gordon wrote of him some years after he won the Gordon Medal in 1906, &quot;he did not overstep the mark of sportsmanship.&quot; He excelled in hockey and football and was an exceptional oarsman. He played on the Delphian football team every one of his years at School and was a strong backfield runner on the SPS team of 1905. In 1906, he captained both Delphian and SPS hockey. Filling the position formerly called &quot;center point&quot; on the School team, he was considered the best player of that position the School had seen. He rowed on winning Halcyon Crews for two years, becoming Halcyon and SPS captain in 1906. At Anniversary that same spring, he won the 120-yard hurdles and placed second in both the 220-yard hurdles and the hammer throw. He was a member of the Cadmean and the Scientific Association, sang bass in the Choir, and was co-author of a short play printed in the Horae in the spring of 1906. After graduation he attended Princeton, where his remarkable athletic career continued. During his early years in business, he played amateur hockey, and he kept his hand in at tennis and golf for most of his life. His working career included thirty-five years in the Providence office of Paine, Webber, Jackson and Curtis, as an investment broker and manager. During World War I, he was first assigned to duty as an ensign on a submarine chaser in the Atlantic, and then, for the final months of the war, as an instructor in the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Few alumni have maintained closer or more loyal attachment to the School. He broke the tape in the Alumni Dash at his tenth and fifteenth reunions and was regularly on hand for Anniversary until the year before his death. He is survived by a son, Frederic B. Read, Jr., '36; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. He was the brother of the late Albert M. Read, '00, Charles N. Read, '04, Malcolm E. Read, '09, and Robert O.

That's Ellis Island in the background: \n&quot;Now a section of Liberty State Park (along Morris Pesin road including the park office and Flag Plaza), Black Tom was originally a small island in New York Harbor not far from Liberty Island. Between 1860 and 1880, Black Tom was connected to the mainland by a causeway and rail lines terminating at a freight facility with docks. The area between the island and the mainland was filled in sometime between 1905 and 1916 by the Lehigh Valley Railroad as part of its Jersey City facility. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Black Tom was serving as a major munitions depot.\n\nBefore the United States entered the First World War, American businessmen would sell their supplies to any buyer. However, by 1915, the British Navy had established a blockade effectively keeping the Germans from being able to buy from the American merchants. The German government, on July 30, 1916, orchestrated the sabotage of freight cars at Black Tom, which were loaded with munitions for the Allies in Europe.\n\nThe wreckage after the Black Tom Explosion.  According to a recent study, the resulting explosion was the equivalent of an earthquake measuring between 5.0 and 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Windows within a 25-mile radius were broken, the outside wall of Jersey City’s City Hall was cracked and pieces of metal damaged the skirt of the Statue of Liberty (it is because of this explosion that the Lady's torch has been closed off to visitors). Most of the immigrants on Ellis Island were temporarily evacuated. Losses were estimate at $20 million and seven people were killed.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_park/liberty_blacktomexplosion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_p...</a>","To get an idea of the force of the explosion, that's the Ellis Island castle in the background.

However, after spending (too much?) time connecting the dots, I am certain that &quot;McCulloch&quot; is the proper and correct spelling.  \n\nDavid Hugh McCulloch, Sr. <a href=\"http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/juniata/bios/mcculloch-william.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">was born to parents William Turbett McCulloch and Lucretia J.  McManigal</a> in Pennsylvania on April 23, 1890, and he passed away on September 20, 1955.  He was  <a href=\"http://library.duke.edu/exhibits/ponds/models_bios.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">married to Helen Wheeler Fair, and the children I have been able to identify thus far are: Virginia Fair McCulloch (who would marry in 1946 (and divorce in 1956) Bertrand L. Taylor III, then marry (and later divorce) renown diver Peter Robin Gimbel (of Gimbel's Department Stores) in 1960</a>; Alice Fair McCulloch (married to Frederick Hemsley Gillmore in August 1933); Helen Fair McCulloch, and David Hugh McCulloch, Jr.\n\nAlthough the preponderance of evidence points toward &quot;McCulloch&quot; as the proper spelling, that evidence comes primarily from (not necessarily accurate) newspaper society notices of impending marriages, noting  &quot;father David H. McCulloch&quot; as the noted Naval aviator, with homes in both Port Washington, Long Island and Palm Beach, Florida.   What settles the issue is the short life of David Jr.\n\nDavid Hugh McCulloch, Jr.'s birth is announced on Page 13 of the June 30, 1922 issue of The Evening News of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (note, &quot;Mrs. J. Emery Fleisher&quot; is McCulloch, Sr.'s mother, Lucretia, who married Fleisher some time after her first husband William passed away at the age of 41 in 1894):\n\n<i>Mrs. J. Emery Fleisher has received the announcement of the birth of a grandson, David Hugh McCulloch, Jr., son of Mr. and Mrs. David Hugh McCulloch, of New York City, June 24. Mr. McCulloch, the father, is the famous aviator who was on the Ill-fated N-3 which floundered several years ago near the Asores on its trans-Atlantic flight</i>\n\nIf you go to Find-A-Grave, two headstones stand next to each other at Woodlawn Cemetery in Palm Beach, Florida.  One is for David Hugh McCulloch, Jr. &quot;June 24, 1922 - December 7, 1922&quot;\nSee:\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.net/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=96138161\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.net/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=96138161</a>\n\nThe adjacent headstone is for David Hugh McCulloch, Sr. &quot;April 23, 1890 - September 20, 1955&quot;\nSee:\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.net/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=96138063\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.net/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=96138063</a>\n\nIt is curious and somewhat disheartening that there is no notation of his service (and achievements in aviation), nor of his family, other than the immediate proximity of the grave of his son who died at too young an age.  Similarly, it is surprising that there isn't any information (obituaries, notices, etc.) reporting or noting his own passing in 1955 that can be located thus far (perhaps as more publications are digitized, this is will change?).\n\nHowever, with the knowledge that McCulloch was born in Pennsylvania (see also the story about the historic flight of the Curtiss NC Flying boats to the Azores on page 36 in the May 4, 1919 Brooklyn Eagle - <i>&quot;Lt. David H. McCulloch, considered one of the best pilots in the Naval Aviation Corps, has been in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps since 1917 when he was 27 years old, having been born in Pennsylvania in 1890.&quot;</i>), combined with the notice of his son's birth, and the aforementioned grave site information, we can say for a certainty that the proper spelling of the name is &quot;McCulloch&quot;, and for the first time as far as I am aware, we can say with a reasonable certainty that he was born on April 23, 1890 and passed on September 20, 1955.","Thanks, TVL1970, for all the research and deduction!

But at the same time, the City passed a Zoning Resolution, which in this instance prohibited businesses along that block of 58th Street because it was residential. Steinway rescinded its purchase agreements, and the sellers filed suits. Steinway lost and was obligated to proceed in taking title to the properties. Plans for a new building were further delayed due to the company's finances after a piano workers strike in 1919.

Following graduation from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1877, he was assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry at Fort Walla Walla, Washington, participating in the 1878 Bannock Indian Campaign in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. He was on detached service in 1879 at the Umatill Indian Agency, Oregon, in operations against Sheepeater and Bannock Indians.\n\nWilliam Carey Brown commanded the 10th Cavalry and Fort Huachuca from 1914 to 1916, and led the regiment into Mexico during the Punitive Expedition, Later as a Brigadier General he would serve in Europe during World War 1. The parade field on Fort Huachuca's Old Post is named for him.\n\nHe served as commanding officer of Troop C, 1st U.S. Cavalry, at Fort Assinniboine, Montana, in the winter campaign of 1890-91 against the Sioux. Other assignments took him to West Point and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.\n\nHis service included time as cavalry troop commander at Fort Grant and San Carlos, Arizona, in the 1880s. Brigadier General Brown's days as troop and field officer included chasing the renegade Apache Kid in Arizona and commanding a troop in the Battle of San Juan, Cuba. He was instrumental in the development of the U.S. Army emergency field ration, the introduction of aluminum to lighten U.S. Army equipment, and other important inventions to improve weapons and equipment.\n\nAs colonel of cavalry he assumed command of the 10th U.S. Cavalry at Fort Huachuca on December 8, 1914, and deployed the regiment along the Mexican border to enforce U.S. neutrality laws during the revolution which then wracked Mexico. When Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa burned Columbus, New Mexico, on March 8, 1916, Brown led his regiment in the Mexican Punitive Expedition under General Pershing. There he distinguished himself in the last combat rides of the U.S. Cavalry, after rationing his men out of his own pocket.\n\nMost prominent of his exploits was a forced march of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, led by him, which rescued the 7th U.S. Cavalry from a siege of carranzistas, at Parral on April 12, 1916. Later as a brigadier general, he was sent to France during World War I as inspector, Quartermaster Corps, General Headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces. There he saved the Army hundreds of thousands of dollars while supervising the receipt, storage, conservation, rehabilitation, and distribution of property and supplies, winning the Distinguished Service Medal and the Silver Star Medal for his work.\n\nBrig.

His monthly allowance was 25 cents. He devoted two-thirds of that and all of his spare time to a Sunday school for poor children. Two of his pupils there are now the wives of Christian  missionaries in Hawaii and California.  Kim came to America when still quite young, and at San Francisco pleaded with Dwight Moody, the evangelist, to help him get an education. He has been doing evangelistic work in Japan since 1901. He paid one visit to America during that period, especially to study the methods of Billy Sunday. He has used like methods in Japan and with great success. &quot;\n<a href=\"http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1916-08-06/ed-1/seq-62/\" rel=\"nofollow\">oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1916-08-06/ed-1/se...</a>","Thanks Seuss and Art, we'll include his full name and narrow down the date range.","The caption, 7th regiment departs, is copied incorrectly from the negative.

His obituary from the December, 1934, issue of &quot;The New York National Guardsman&quot; magazine.\n&quot;THE LATE BRIG. GEN. CHARLES H. HITCHCOCK \nBy Lt. Col. Floyd D. McLean, Inf. Res. \nIF ever a man exemplified in his life the true attributes of an officer and a gentleman, that man \nwas the late Brigadier General Charles H. Hitchcock, who answered the last roll call on October 30, 1934. \nAn accomplished student of the classics and a translator of the works of Greek philosophers and historians, he was as much at home with Horace and Virgil as with Blackstone and Clausewits. He had several translations printed of the Greek plays among the last of which was Agamemnon of Aeschylus about five years ago and he wrote a number of articles for the service journals under his own name and also under the nom de plume of N. G. Miles which those who remember their Latin will recognise as National Guard Soldier. \nBorn of pioneer stock in Binghamton on November 12, 1857, he was educated in the public schools and graduated from Hamilton Collège in 1879, later teaching school for a short period and then beginning the study of law in which he became distinguished, particularly in the branch of real estate and land titles. He became a partner in the law firm of Jenkins, Deyo and Hitchcock. \nEnlisting in the old 20th Separate Company in 1882 he came up through ail grades to Captain in 1897 and commanded Company H of the 1st New York Volunteers during the Spanish-American War when that désignation was given to the 20th Separate Company before the regiment went to the Hawaiian Islands where it remained until Christmas time in 1898. Thereafter General Hitchcock's advancement was rapid and he became Colonel, commanding the 1st New York Infantry in 1905, being breveted Brigadier General on July 19, 1910. \nAt one time he was président of the National Guard Association of the State of New York and was later a member of the governor's military council. Standing over six feet tall with a fine military bearing, one would instantly recognise him as a soldier even in mufti. \nBecause of ill health he went on the reserve list on March 5, 1917, but offered to the Government any service that he was able to render. He was detailed to active duty in the Adjutant Genera's office of New York State on April 18, 1917, where he served for several months. He was later given a commission in command of a company of the United States Guards on June 10, 1918, serving at Fort Niagara and later in the shipyard at Newburgh, New York. He was honorably discharged \nfrom United States service on February 1, 1919, with the same rank that he held at the end of the Spanish-American War although meantime he had successfully commanded a regiment of Infantry for more than 12 years. \nHe was a member of the Thomas H. Barbour Camp, United Spanish War Vétérans; Army and Navy Club, New York City; a charter member of Binghamton Post 80, American Légion and a member of the Richard J. Hoyt Post 478, Vétérans of Foreign Wars. He had served his city as Commissioner of Health and was a member of the Court of Honor of the Boy Scouts of America up to the time of his death. In 1891 he married Miss Estelle Heath of Ithaca who survives. \nOne of the last public functions that he attended was the review of the 10th Infantry and 104th Field Artillery during the Binghamton Centennial on October 9. The final military honors were in charge of the 10th Infantry. &quot;Honor, Duty, Country&quot; was his creed, and he lived up to it in his personal and public life, giving unselfish service to his community, state and nation. &quot;\n<a href=\"http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/research/NY_National_Guardsman/NYNG1934_12.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">dmna.ny.gov/historic/research/NY_National_Guardsman/NYNG1...</a>\nSee also<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8009366195\" title=\"Gen.

However, it was pacifism and Wilson’s commitment to keeping the United States out of \nthe raging conflict in Europe that dominated the convention. By the second day, Wilson’s \ndetermined neutrality regarding the war became the theme of the convention, and the slogan “He \nkept us out of the war” became the battle cry of the delegates. \nThe Democratic platform included a call for military preparedness and the progressive reforms \nmade by the Wilson administration, particularly with respect to tariffs, banking, labor and \nagriculture. The only section of the platform brought to a floor vote was the plank on women’s \nsuffrage. The majority plank favored extending the vote to women, while a minority plank \nadvocated leaving the matter to the individual states. The minority plank was defeated by a vote \nof 888 ½ to 181 ½. The Democratic position on women’s suffrage contrasted with that of the \nRepublicans, who proposed leaving the matter up to the individual states. &quot; <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/main/democratic_conventions.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/rr/main/democratic_conventions.pdf</a>","Thanks for providing this link and a summary of the events of the convention, artolog.","See comment on:\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/13466845324/\" title=\"Glynn, Taggart, James (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7021/13466845324_1d6f78d171_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"163\" alt=\"Glynn, Taggart, James (LOC)\" /></a>","Thanks for your research swanq.

He \ncommanded Groupe de Bombardement 4 as well as Escadrille 29.

He [was] obsessed with one concern: accomplishing everything that was his duty. His gaze softened or turned dark depending on his mood.

Hill, who was known as the empire builder because of the work he did in building up the Northwest, was photographed not long before his death on one of the great farms along the line of the Great Northern Railroad, with his son. Louis W. Hill. Louis Hill has succeeded his father in the control of his great business Interests. &quot;\n\nJ.J. Hill died on May 29, 1916, so this was circulated by Bain around that time.  Louis W.

They don't 'mister' any one in St. Paul, not even a Hill. Louis is not the oldest son of James J. Hill. James N. Hill of New York is the first born. There was never a close bond of sympathy in business affairs between the father and his heir apparent.   The third son, Walter, prefers farming to any other occupation.

Hill purchased 3,500 acres of land in Moundsview and White Bear Townships from Charles D. Gilfillan. Hill named his property North Oaks Farm, and in the next few years purchased adjacent farms to increase his land ownership to about 5,500 acres. Hill's plan was to build a farm that would support his Great Northern Railway and the immigrant settlers the railroad brought to establish farms along its tracks.\n\nHill saw his North Oaks Farm as an opportunity to improve both the agriculture and livestock and pass that knowledge on to the settlers to ensure their success, as well as supply them with seeds, supplies and livestock. As the farmers prospered, Hill theorized, so would the railroad.\n\nIn its heyday, 400 men worked at the farm which had more than 40 buildings, some of which still stand and are part of the historic farm site and listed on the national registry.\n\nLouis Hill inherited the farm when James J. died in 1916. Upon Louis's death, his son, Louis Hill, Jr., took over the day-to-day operations of the farm, farming a portion of the land and keeping the rest as woodland.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.northoaks.com/history.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.northoaks.com/history.htm</a>","Very similar photo in The New York Times, June 11, 1916\n  <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/np_item.pl?collection=sgproto&amp;agg=sgpnyt&amp;iss=19160611&amp;page=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/np_item.pl?collection=sgproto&amp;...</a>\ncaptioned &quot;Japanese nurses reach Tokio [sic] after twenty-two months of nursing the Russian wounded, wearing flowers presented by the Russian Embassy in Tokio and decorations bestowed by the Russian goverment.

In the city of Ilion, New York, home of the company, a grand celebration was held lasting three days, from 29-31 August, featuring a poster contest, speeches by numerous dignitaries, a monument dedication, band music and a parade. Thousands of visitors crowded into the small village to enjoy the celebration.\n\n&quot;To honor the achievement of 100 years in business The Centennial Commission of the Village of Ilion commissioned the noted sculptor, <b>Albin Polasek</b> (1879-1965), to produce a statue of the company's founder, Eliphalet Remington II. From the clay original were produced bronze statues, and one was sent to the Adjutant General of each state 'from the Village of Ilion.'\n\n&quot;The letter, which accompanied each 40-pound statue, stated that its purpose was to encourage an interest in rifle practice and marksmanship by the 'organized militia' of each state. The details were left up to each state. The plaque on each statue states: 'Presented by Citizens of Ilion, New York to Organized Military of the U. S. for Perpetual Competition.' The donors suggested that each statue be awarded annually to the state military organization represented by the winning rifle team in a special match to be known as 'The Remington Centennial Trophy Match.'\n\n&quot;Albin Polasek, Czech-American sculptor was born at Frenstat in Moravia, the Czech-Republic in 1879. He came to the U.S. in 1901, making his trade as a wood craver. In 1906 he studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  Subsequent to studies in Italy and Greece; he started his own studio in New York City. In 1916 he went to Chicago, where he was head of the Department of Sculpture at the Art Institute until 1943. In 1949, he purchased property on Lake Osceola in Winter Park, Florida and built his retirement home and studio. He continued to create his art until his death at the age of 86 on May 19, 1965. Today, the Albin Polasek Foundation operates his residence and studio in Winter Park, as the Albin Polasek Museum and Sculpture Gardens.\n\n&quot;Eliphalet Remington II, (1793-1861) inventor, gunsmith, and arms manufacturer was born in Suffield, Connecticut. Remington was trained as a blacksmith, but turned to gunsmithing at an early age. With his father, he founded a smithy in upstate New York originally manufacturing farm tools. In 1816, Remington introduced a highly accurate rifle, the demand for which changed the focus of the business to firearms production. Upon his father’s death in 1828, Eliphalet took control of the business and established a rifle factory at Ilion, New York. ... On August 12, 1861, Eliphalet Remington died, and his son Philo took over the firm.” <i>&mdash;<a href=\"http://kynghistory.ky.gov/awdsdecorations/remington+centennial+trophy.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Guard History eMuseum</a> and Remington Arms Museum</i>","Photo was used in <a href=\"http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1916-06-25/ed-1/seq-62/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sunday Oregonian.

A favorite production is Verdi's Requiem Mass which has frequently been presented by opera companies and choral societies but never perhaps on so large a scale as in the first outdoor presentation of it in New York under the auspices of the National Open Air Festival Society. The chorus consisted of 1,200 singers selected from among the leading choral societies of New York, the accompaniments were played by an orchestra of 120 and among the soloists were four world wide celebrities: Giovanni Zenatello,  Mme Maria Gay,  Miss Lucille Lawrence and Léon Rothier.   All these immense forces were under the leadership of Mr. Louis Koemmenich.   To make it possible to carry out the production on a scale of magnitude such as will inaugurate a new era in the musical development of this country, the New York Polo Grounds were chosen and a huge stage constructed with a sounding board large enough to reflect the sound of the many voices.

Although for twenty years the Chairman of the School of Landscape Architecture, his work was not of a nature to make him widely known among the men outside his department and its real importance might easily be overlooked. There were few honors in his profession that Professor Pray had not attained at one stage or another of his career. The list of institutes and societies of which he was an active member is world-wide in its scope and includes as perhaps his greatest distinction the American Academy in Rome, of which he was for five years trustee and executive member. Professor Pray also took a prominent part in the development of the science of city planning that has grown to such importance during recent years. Much as his students in the Architectural School will miss the leadership of Professor Pray, they are but the least to regret his loss. A whole profession is the poorer for his passing.

His position will be unfortunate.\nSo that every citizen in Newark may see this instructive and entertaining event during at least one of its four evening performances, the Committee has provided for 40,000 seats, half of which are free, the other half reserved.\nIf you wish to learn something of the beauty and historic phase of the Pageant, you should attend the weekly mass meetings being held in various parts of the city for the purpose of recruiting volunteers for its cast, chorus or other departments. This is a Newark pageant, composed of Newark citizens of all ages, nations and degrees. There is room for every volunteer. Seven thousand persons will be trained for the parts and those who work in shops are as essential as those who play in society. It is to be a very democratic pageant in which all the people shall participate either as actors, singers, dancers, mob units, helpers, or as skilled mechanics and craftsmen.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=6e0-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=6e0-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;f...</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Treat\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Treat</a>\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bookofwordspagea00stev\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.org/details/bookofwordspagea00stev</a>\nSee also:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/12118968294/\" title=\"Blue Jay - Newark Pageant (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/12118968294_880e0a8608_n.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Blue Jay - Newark Pageant (LOC)\" /></a>","grace!","The Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Giants met at the Polo Grounds in New York on April 20 and 21, 1916.

Revivals of this tradition are still celebrated annually in South Gloucestershire, England on Boxing Day and in parts of Ireland on St. Stephen's Day and also in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador around Christmas.\n\nSwedes, Philadelphia's first settlers, brought the custom of visiting neighbours on &quot;Second Day Christmas&quot; (December 26) with them to Tinicum.
