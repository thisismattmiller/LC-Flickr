The Magnus Butler machine appears to be a mechanized dump wagon. There's no visible cleaning apparatus (rotary brush, conveyors, belts, etc.), just a tilting hopper with a gate at the rear and access doors on the sides.\n\nThe streets of NYC were apparently still being cleaned by men with pushbrooms and hand carts. Machines were found to be less effective and more expensive than manual laborers. The Magnus Butler motorized wagon was probably designed as a collection vehicle to carry away the rubbish from the hand carts and dump it elsewhere. The raised letters on the rear wheel casting, visible in another photo, suggest the machine may have been made in Mass. (it could just indicate the maker of the wheel hubs, but the hubs are unusual, so they could have been custom-made )\nSee <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2497227956/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2497227956/</a>\n\nFor more about street cleaning, download MODERN METHODS OF STREET CLEANING by GEORGE A.

While the New York Times is often a fairly reliable source for the spelling of a name, the December 15, 1912 article mentioned in several comments includes misspellings. It is identified as 'Special to the New York Times', and so may have been provided by a visiting correspondent - and not well fact-checked. This photograph shows Mrs. Malcolm Strauss and her prize-winning French Bulldog Beaux Athos.   Bain provides the identities as: Mrs. Malcolm Strauss and Beaux Attos, and this Dec 1912 column offers Mrs. Martin Straus and Beau Athos, where both names are incorrect.\n\nNumerous other articles in the New York Times reporting results of dog shows in great detail confirm both the name of the owner - and her husband - and her dog.  A good authority for the dog's name in particular is the American Kennel Stud Book of 1913, published by the National American Kennel Club.  Here he is noted as: Beaux Athos. \n\nWe will amend the record to include the correct name for the bulldog.","This guy had an interesting life. Maurice Bennett &quot;Lefty&quot; Flynn (born Greenwich, Connecticut on May 26, 1892) was a star athlete at Yale in the early 1910s. His college football career was cut short in 1913 when he was barred from the school following his marriage to a chorus girl, Irene Leary. (<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505EEDC163FE633A2575BC0A9679C946296D6CF\">New  York Times article</a>.) The couple separated after 11 days, and their divorce became final the next year (<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980CE4DF163AE633A2575BC1A9649C946596D6CF\">New York Times article</a>.) In 1916 he married a second time, to Blanche Shove Palmer, with whom he had two children.\r\n\r\nThe world had not heard the last of Lefty, though. By 1919, he had begun a career in movies which would last until 1927 (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0283555/\">IMDb filmography page</a>.) His Hollywood career included another brief marriage, to silent star <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199087/\">Viola Dana</a>. Their movie careers ended with the silent era, and they were divorced in 1929.\r\n\r\nBy the 1930s, Lefty was living in Tryon, North Carolina and was married to the former Nora Langhorne Phipps, youngest sister of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Astor,_Viscountess_Astor\">Nancy, Viscountess Astor</a>, and of Irene Gibson, said to have been one of the models for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_girl\">Gibson Girl</a>, created by her husband, illustrator Charles Dana Gibson.\r\n\r\nThe Flynns were acquainted with F. Scott Fitzgerald, and it was with them that <a href=\"http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/facts/facts4.html#4\">his daughter Scottie stayed</a> when Fitzgerald went to Tryon for his health in 1935. Zelda Fitzgerald's biographer, Nancy Cline, claims that Scott Fitzgerald had an affair with Nora Flynn. \r\n\r\nI've been unable to find whether or not Lefty and Nora remained married until Nora's death in 1955 (her obituary in the Hickory Daily Record refers to her as Mrs. Nora Langhorne Flynn), but Lefty married once again, to Lesley Bogert, before his own death on March 6, 1959, in Camden, South Carolina.","I started a Wikipedia entry for him:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Bennett_Flynn\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Bennett_Flynn</a>","Another Bain/LOC photo of the Harvard football scrimmage -- this one dated 9/26/12:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2422676977/]","New York Times story, September 15, 1912:\n&quot;Harvard's Football Outlook Promising&quot;-------\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E3DC1F3CE633A25756C1A96F9C946396D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E3DC1F3CE6...</a>\n\nNew York Times Article, September 17, 1912:\n&quot;Harvard on Gridiron&quot; -----\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9900EED7123CE633A25754C1A96F9C946396D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9900EED7123CE6...</a>\n\nNew York Times Article, September 18, 1912:\n&quot;More Men For Harvard&quot; -----\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE2D81630E233A2575BC1A96F9C946396D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE2D81630E2...</a>\n\nNew York Times story, September 19, 1912:\n&quot;Harvard Quarter Back Find&quot; -----\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02E6D6123CE633A2575AC1A96F9C946396D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02E6D6123CE6...</a>\n\nNew York Times story, September 20, 1912:\n&quot;Harvard Squads to be Selected To-Day&quot;-----\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9807EFD81630E233A25753C2A96F9C946396D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9807EFD81630E2...</a>","Otis Love Guernsey was a Yale football player (a &quot;kicking fullback,&quot; in the New York Times) and &quot;squash tennis&quot; player.

All of the family members were born in New York with the exception of Edith C., who was born in Washington.\r\n\r\nGiven their ages in 1920, it is likely that the photograph above was taken several years later than 1910, as Harry would have been two years old and Edith only one year old in 1910.

P. Taylor. The race was a revival of an earlier annual event; there had been no coach race in 1911. It was delayed twice by accidents on the course, which were caused by horses slipping on asphalt pavement. \n\nThe 1912 race began at the Arrowhead Inn (built in 1908, torn down in 1923) in Washington Heights [at 178th St. (now the George Washington Bridge road, or I-95) and Haven Ave.], and ended at Madison Square Garden, where a throng of spectators waited patiently for the arrival of each coach-and-four. \n\nPresumaby this photograph shows the beginning of the 1913 race, this time with Seelig and Taylor joining forces against a competitor identified as &quot;Judge Moore.&quot; Alas, veterinarians disqualified one of the Judge's horses for lameness, and Taylor won by default. On the other hand, the 1913 NYT story says Taylor drove a yellow coach. Does the coach in the photo look yellow? The 1913 story doesn't say where the race began.","The driver is E. Fownes.  The other guy in the front is Paul A. Sorg.

Launched at Port Glasgow, Scotland in 1908, she was interned at Hoboken, New Jersey, after World War I began in August 1914. When the United States entered the conflict in April 1917, she was taken over by the Army Quartermaster Corps. The Navy acquired the ship in November 1917 and placed her in commission in January 1918. Martha Washington made her first transport voyage to France in February and during the remainder of the First World War crossed the Atlantic seven more times, bringing more than 24,000 personnel to Europe.\n\nWith the Armistice in November, Martha Washington reversed the pattern, making seven trips over the next year to return nearly 20,000 passengers to America. In August 1919, she was sent into the Mediterranean and Black Seas to carry a U.S. mission to Turkey and Russia. During this three-month voyage, she also carried refugees from Batum, Russia, to Constantinople, Turkey. Martha Washington decommissioned in November 1919, shortly after her return to the U.S. from Turkey, and was sold back to her Austrian former owners in November 1922.\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-m/id3019.htm\">www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-m/id3019.htm</a>","No mention of The USS Martha Washington taking passengers from Split Yugoslavia in steerage on May 6th 1914.....why?","Here is an article (10/6/1912 from NYTimes) that mentions that the passenger liner, Martha Washington, was carrying Greek reservists who had been summoned home by royal decree. \r\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D00E4D7113AE633A25755C0A9669D946396D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D00E4D7113AE6...</a>","The liner in the little cartouch on the carriage is the Olympic of 1911 - however I can't help but wonder if it's perhaps a mislabeled memorial to the 1915 sinking of the Lusitania, considering the &quot;we are off to war,&quot; banner.

Queen Olga, age 62, became a dowager at this point, another word for a widow.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Greece</a>\r\n\r\nGeorge was succeeded by his and Olga's oldest son who became <b> King Constantine</b> (1868-1923), who was Christopher's brother.  Constantine was educated at Heidelberg University in Germany, trained in the Prussian army, and married to a nice Prussian girl, <b>Princess Sophie of Prussia</b> (1870-1932).  On her mother's side Sophie's grandparents were <b>Queen Victoria</b> and <b>Prince Albert</b> of England.  Her grandfather on her father's side was German emperor and her father was German emperor too and so was her brother,  <b>Kaiser Wilhelm II</b> of Germany.  \r\n\r\nConstantine was king of Greece from 1913-1917.   During World War I Greece was neutral but eventually sided with the Allies.  Constantine was was forced to abdicate and leave Greece due to his pro-German affiliations and sympathies.  He abdicated in favor of his second son (and Olga's grandson) <b> Alexander </b> who did not last long as king.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece</a>","Alexander (1893-1920) was king from 1917 to 1920.  In 1919 <b> King Alexander </b> scandalously married a commoner, <b>Aspasia Manos</b>, (1896-1972) who is standing on the left, next to Olga.  Alexander was was 26 and Aspasia was 23.  This scandal led to King Alexander having to flee to Paris.  He returned but not long after he died of bites from an altercation in the garden with his two pet monkeys.  He was 27.  (Not making this up!)  Alexander died in October 1920 and his grandmother, Olga, served as <b> Regent of Greece</b> until her son Constantine could return from exile in Switzerland to be king for a second time.   He abdicated for the second time, in 1922.  \r\n\r\nPrince Christopher married a wealthy American widow in early 1920.  He was later to become an uncle of the current Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Konstantinovna_of_Russia\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Konstantinovna_of_Russia</a>  \r\n       \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece</a>\r\n  \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Prussia\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Prussia</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Greece</a>\r\n \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Aspasia\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Aspasia</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Christopher_of_Greece_and_Denmark\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Christopher_of_Greece_and_De...</a>","Olga (1851-1926)\r\nChristopher: (1888-1940)\r\nAspasia (1896-1972)\r\n\r\nIf we guess that this is around the time of Aspasia's secret wedding on November 4, 1919 (or Alexander's funeral in 1920) then Olga has been a widow for 6 years and she is 68 in this pic, Chris would be age 31 and Aspasia age 23.

I assume it is white in celebration of the wedding.\r\n\r\nYou may recall many photographs of Queen Victoria wearing a similar headdress, but always in black as mourning for her beloved Prince Albert.  \r\n\r\nSure looks like a wedding day pic to me, and certainly Aspasia is older than 16 years in this pic.  Looks like a wedding veil on her head too.\r\n\r\nIf Aspasia's wedding was &quot;secret&quot; then it is fascinating that they permitted a photo to make it to a news service.","White mourning was considered a privelege of queens in Europe (although not generally practiced by Orthodox Queens).  White mourning was first a privilege of Queens of France.  Numerous other queens adopted the practice.  There is a famous portrait of Mary Queen of Scots in white mourning for her first husband Francis II of France.  However, black mourning was adopted by Catherine de Medici (Mary's first mother-in-law) upon the death of her husband Henri II, and she wore it for the rest of her life.  Black mourning then increasingly became the norm for Queens.  When Marie Antoinette was taken to be executed she was instructed by her jailers not to wear black mourning, and was provided with a white dress and mob cap.  Ironically it seems they didn't realize they were unwittingly giving her the privilege of white mourning which was reserved for Queens.\n\nQueen Elizabeth the Queeen Mother, while Queen Consort to George VI caused a sensation during a state visit to France in which she wore all white during her entire visit.  Her mother the Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorn had recently died, and in order not to cast a pall on the state visit with black clothing, the Queen decided to adopt white mourning for her mother.  Even more recently the Duch Royal family adopted white mourning upon the death of former Queen Juliana.","Original photo was blindstamped in lower right corner: \n&quot;Thalmand Freres [Brothers]\nMontreux-Vevey [Switzerland]&quot;\n\nThere's also a date inscribed down there, \nbut it may be both upside-down and backwards.","great photo!!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/69656089@N00/\">Vintage Monocle</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","The bride is not Aspacia\n but Anastasia Nonnie May &quot;Nancy&quot; Stewart Oldenburg\nThus it is a photo of 1 February 1920.

The WNW&amp;MO organized mass meetings for women throughout New York City. [Daisy] Harriman was often surprised to find that more men than women came to her meetings. At her first mass meeting on August 20th in Union Square, Harriman found herself addressing a crowd of 388 men and boys, but only 12 women. She asked the men to pass on her remarks to their wives, overlooking the fact that New York women were being appealed to solely so they could influence their husbands’ votes. All went smoothly until Harriman and her band pulled out campaign buttons and started to toss them to the crowd. In the men’s rush to grab the trinkets, the rally almost became a riot, and the police had to be called in.

Miraculously, there was no loss of human life, though four or five calves were killed. Clean-up operations were extensive, and tree experts were brought in to salvage what trees could be saved. Mr. Lewis sold the Guernseys, rather than replace the barns.

The trip was an adventure: the vessel's freeboard was only 21/2 feet so she was usually awash and always rolling; the engine noise was deafening; and the boat caught fire and nearly blew up. After completing the rugged North Sea leg, Day writes, &quot;...The last thing I did was to visit the engine room and kiss the motor good-bye...&quot;\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting of course to be able to identify the people in the photograph.

Amateur seafaring, he said, is a healthy thing to do. “A noble art makes noble men, and there is no nobler art than seamanship.” Besides building character, Day knew that an ocean race would improve the breed of sailboats by testing them on the open sea. He arranged with the Brooklyn Yacht Club to start it the race in New York Bay, and with the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club to finish it off St. David’s Light. Besides establishing a mission for the race, Day skippered the first winner.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe also edited a magazine called &quot;The Cruiser&quot; and wrote several books on sailing.","This is presumably a photo of a photo by Niebergall.

Their 104-foot flying ship, finished almost to the last details, is at Kane's Amphitheatre, at Clason Point, awaiting a trial trip, which the inventors intend to make soon, probably to Governors Island.

C., in June, 1912, when Taft was the incumbent President. This was his second experience of the notification ritual. The committee had traveled from the Republican National Convention in Chicago {yes, Chicago again} where Taft had been nominated for a second term. In the era before a candidate attended the convention in person, this was his ceremonial acceptance.\n\nBut of course, Taft went down to defeat in November. Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic candidate, was victorious, and Theodore Roosevelt, leader of the Bull Moose Party, came in second.\n\nIn the Bain Company files at LOC is a photo of Taft's 1908 notification, in Cincinnati (his home town) -- but LOC has not yet posted that photo on Flickr.","I believe the man to the right of Taft (Taft's left) is Luther A.

In those Days Gone By, most Children on Farms worked hard.   Not only to pick up the Potatoes, but they had the job of hauling them to the Cold Cellar.   This Photo is Great Tribute to the Boys, from way back then.","Yes, the Sweet Boy is crying.   It was lots of work and getting colder.    They are very Young and were made to pick up the Potatoes.    It was not easy.   Poor Little Fella's.","Just a few miles down the road from here.  The land still looks much like this, but with more trees.  It's odd to see such an old photo that (other than the horse and buggy) could've been taken yesterday on just about any rural road a few miles from here.","It's a shame there are JPG compression artifacts on these photos.

Perhaps for photographic reasons?","nice sharp photograph","I like that there is no motion. When I first saw the photo, I had a feeling of stopping time - not just in a photography sense, but in a completely surreal way.\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like a jockey on the left...","The colors of the clothing on the folks in the cart are interesting: orange to purple to black.

I love this peek into their lives, the colors of the outfits, the hats, the carriage. Awesome project!","Yes - me too - but I have a slightly uncomfortable sense of being a voyeur!","Awesome! Great shot! Very nice!!!!!!!!!!","Maybe the cart isn't moving because they are pulled over to the side of the road, waiting for a car to pass. Notice that the road is paved. It could have been a racial disparity, where blacks still drove mule-pulled buggies, because they couldn't afford cars.. or it could just be that this particular family still traveled that way by choice. In any case, I doubt the photo was staged, or that they were stopping for photographic reasons. It looks like a simple act of highway courtesy, because they were moving slowly.","classic shot! like it!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/648148@N23/\">Foto Roman</a>, and we'd love to have your photo added to the group.","My mother is 81 years old.

The properties of the starch in the potatoes will actually change during storage so new potatoes with their thin, delicate skins are best for boiling, old potatoes are best for baking.  When you've been eating the potatoes from last year's harvest, the first harvest of new ones is a real treat!","There's new potatoes and old potatoes, and then there's old new potatoes and new new potatoes . . . .","I just downloaded the pic and the seeds are flower seeds for 5 cents per packet...  interesting.","great shot.","Follow-up to oloranch's comment - this is where the downtown Lincoln YMCA is now.","Think about this: those citrus fruits  must have had to be shipped for hundreds of miles to get to that market. That was, and still is, no small feat. It supplied people with delicious, nutritious fruit, but now we take it for granted that oranges will be available, whether we're in California or Michigan(and It's taking a toll). It's nice to appreciate what energy has to be spent to get us those simple &quot;necessities&quot;. Potatoes could have been grown locally, but that citrus, man, it's a world-traveler.","pejorg2000, I believe that even-numbered addresses are on the north side of the street. If they were back in Grand Grocery's day then I'm thinking the store would have either been located where the Embassy Suites or on the southeast corner of the block which is occupied by the Journal Star. I could very easily be wrong though.","Regarding roderickbodine's observation that the oranges in the center of the pile looked brown- It looks to me that those particular oranges are not brown, but are wrapped in tissue paper. For those not old enough to remember, it was for many decades the custom of fruit packers to wrap fruits individually in sheets of colored tissue paper. \r\n\r\nSometimes the tissue was blank, but most often it contained the brand name of the fruit packer. (<a href=\"http://www.nationalfinder.com/fruitwrappers/index.htm\">Here's a web page about fruit wrappers</a>.) The practice on wrapping individual pieces of fruit faded away in the U.S. in the 1950s, but I gather that it is still done in some countries that have lower labor costs. Today, of course, fruits in American markets are branded by those little stickers that are so hard to peel off. I preferred the tissue, but it was undoubtedly more wasteful of resources.","my grandfather chewed Copenhagen","I wish I could get five oranges for the same price as 8 oz. of Pepsi.

For the full story on how we digitized the FSA Color photographs, go to <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/fsacdig.html\">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/fsacdig.html</a>","These are amazing and inspiring! What a collection!!!\r\n\r\nI love how he women had class and style, and weren't afraid to work hard !","Kodachrome uses external dye couplers that are added at the time of processing. All other color films use dye couplers integrated with the emulsion. This makes the Kodachrome process much more complicated but the image is far more stable.

I wonder where she is now and if she knows we are all admiring her.","Style, grace and beauty with amazing lighting....","The reason for the fine color, undoubtedly with no restoration, has been explained.  Also consider that LC will have kept the slides in proper storage conditions, which many home slides and phots are not stored in.\r\n\r\nRemember that this was during WWII, when a great deal of the factory and other work was done by &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; and her friends.  If you don't know that poster image, google it (or yahoo it). Women did indeed do all sorts of &quot;factory work&quot; and men's work that they'd never done before, as all the men were off fighting and dying.\r\n\r\nAlso consider that it is 99 percent sure that this was NOT a candid, but a posed shot of a selected woman who was told to dress more formally, wear makeup, and so forth.  \r\n\r\nWomen's Lib?  Probably not.  It was a wartime necessity, and afterwards a great many of them went back to usual &quot;women's work&quot; at home.

And that being said, there's certainly room to improve the JPEG encoding of these images even without touching the colour-balance - just compare the large version of this image to the large version of mine to see the extra detail that's there. I've uploaded the full 7788x6384 pixel image there if you want a look - it's about 7MB.","i agree that she looks beautiful, and out of place yet perfectly comfortable in her surroundings.

Posters such as this were used to motivate the public and keep the moralle at a higher level. I guess this was the first kind of &quot;subversive&quot; advertising, only with a noble purpose.","If it is a Kodachrome, likely is, it is not at all unusual that the color are this saturated and flesh tones so lifelike. A hallmark of the grainless compostion of this photographer's favorite emulsion.\r\n\r\nAlso, if it kodachrome then this is a studio shot - definintly couldn't eb documentary candid news photo. Why? Other than all the obvious art direction and styling cues for of the model and hair and dress, Kodachrome is extremely slow-speed film meaning there has to be a light/strobe kit involved in the making of this image. And a tripod for the camera .. and. I love the LOC for this.","You're right; it's Kodachrome sheet film. \r\n\r\nThis good conversation made us wonder if other photos in the b&amp;w FSA/OWI collection could offer additional clues to the context. Found  <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/fsa.8b02908\"> one more portrait of this woman </a> with a caption that mentions &quot;Hollywood missed a good bet when they overlooked this attractive aircraft worker.”\r\n\r\n(The b&amp;w negatives are low resolution since scanned in the 1990s to capture the <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/fsaabt.html\">whole collection of 170,000 b&amp;w negatives</a>.)","Just an innocent question: Is it incidental that these pictures appear to be truly patriotic (all of them but one?) while the caucuses are on their way? Beyond all doubt they are fantastic to look at. But why does it appeal to me, that they are - in the choice that has been made - also 'republican'? I absolutely wish I was wrong.","I don't think the choices have anything to do with political parties. Franklin Roosevelt, the president at the time the photos were taken, was a Democrat.","Wow, this photo looks as though it was taken recently and a model was highly stylized for the shoot. Stunning color and tone.","seeing this photo really gave me context into what they did...\r\nthe attire makeup and complexion of these women seem as if they were more fit for the office... but yet they volunteered for these more heavy and dangerous jobs... perhaps to help their loved ones fighting overseas..","<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/42/buddyicons/10723516@N00.jpg?1173594316\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" /> <b>mospirit</b> and yes i agree... she looks more like a model...","this creates a feeling; brings history to a real level. makes you feel as though this is someone you knew, someone you cared about. history in color. amazing.","Almost all these photos are posed. The clothing is wrong for the job (and too clean). Still, the women might have been real workers, not models.\r\n\r\nIt seems patriotic because it was part of war effort propaganda, but neither party has a monopoly on that. The nation pulled together and pitched in during WWII in a way that it has never done since.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately most of these women were summarily fired after the war so as to make their jobs available for the returning men. Still, it gave them a taste of independence that changed America.","Is that even a pen or pencil or some sort of marker anyway?

I would almost have to be dead now to have lived through that era (instead of being born in it), but sometimes, when I look at these photos and listen to the big band music reminiscent of the times, I almost would trade my life for hers.  She had a gleam in her eye when she spoke about those times.... the sacrifices were a privilege, not a burden.  This photo captures that sentiment precisely.","great, thanks for uploading theses.

Her name isn't Rosie, though. :)","It's not a soldering gun it's a flashlight..\r\nSee my comments above!\r\n;=)","My mother worked in a factory during World War II and she wore her hair in something called a snood while she worked.   (Sort of a hair net) Yes, this is probably a posed shot.  Many photos like this were used to encourage women to go to work in factories, that needed workers.  A large percentage of men were fighting in the war.  Enough history ranting.  It is a great shot.","<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/98/buddyicons/40673076@N00.jpg?1201836140#40673076@N00\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" />   Said <i>&quot;makes me think of how our standards of female beauty have changed&quot;</i> Changed in what way? She's a beautiful woman, now or then...","This was a posed shot, yes, but don't assume that most women didn't dress this way, that she wasn't a real worker or that those aren't her real clothes. There are many candid shots of the period that show women just as well dressed; they simply had different standards of formality than we do. Not everyone who worked in a factory position wore a snood, and lots of women wore dressy snoods as a fashionable item. Considering the kind of work she is doing (inspection) her clothes, hair and makeup are quite reasonable. Most women at that time would find it unthinkable to go out without at least lipstick, unless they were working in a really grubby job. They wanted to work, not give up their femininity.","The rolls of her hair are dressed over rats. It wasn't just curled with curlers and then pinned up.","You don't just go and enter an aircraft factory with a camera and shoot. The photographer certainly had limited mobility and time to do his work, and certainly the workers were aware.\r\n\r\nNow, can you picture a woman not dressing up for a photo-shoot she knows when it will take place? Me neither.\r\n\r\n--\r\n<i><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/sets/72157603671370361/\">Seen in your 1930s-40s in Color set.</a></i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\">?</a>)</em>","this photograph is beyond perfect. the complimentary wires to her arm band, her hair and the red instrument she's got in her hand. the black hair. gorgeous. that dress!","My grandmother was a welder for North American Aviation in Southern California....an artist did a couple of pencil drawings of her working - she worked there around 1943.

Local climate is usually a prime consideration when prescribing winter or summer uniforms.  I can't recall for sure if CMC would set an ultimate date for the seasonal changeover.","The trouser crease on the left leg seems unusually conspicuous in this photo.  It does not appear to be doubled, but looks to be much wider than what I am accustomed to seeing on a USMC uniform.  It could be just the lighting.  And regarding the neck tie, although the cleft near the top, just under the knot, may give a stylish appearance, in the strictest sense, it was not prescribed during the time of my service, 1986 - 1990.","The uniform is called &quot;Service Alphas&quot; it's not seasonal at all. It's generally only worn when reporting to a new unit.","Although there may be only one version worn by today's Marines, those who served 20 years ago were required to maintain two sets of alphas- wool and poly/cotton.  We would unofficially refer to the wool alphas as winter, and the poly alphas as summer, although they were usually prescribed with consideration to environmental temperature  However, for inspection purposes, either style would be designated, at any time. Generally, the poly alphas got a lot more wear than the wool alphas.   Yes, alphas, as well as charlies,  were worn when first reporting in to a unit.   Alphas were also worn for ceremonies such as change of command and annual USMC birthday formations, as well as for formal events such as organized banquets.  I was addressing NiMaGaNiN's question rather than discussing any specific uniform.  Also noteworthy, the seasonal change over involving the utilility blouse specified having the sleeves rolled up for the warmer months.  Some commanders were sticklers for uniformity, which affected the wear of other items such as gloves, scarves, watch caps and field jackets.\nSemper Fi","Does anyone out there know exactly what kind of shoes were worn with this uniform? Did they always match the colour of the belt? I have a uniform with a dark tan belt and wonder if the shoes would match this. These shoes look as though they are dark brown or black leather lace-ups - perhaps ankle boots or shoes? The toes are rounded i think - yes?","during my time of service, 1986 - 1990- not ankle boots.  Shoes.  Blackened leather.  Either &quot;old school&quot; leather with black shoe polish, or modern style Cloroframs.  Belt is khaki style, cotton ( I think), tan, with plain brass buckle and plain brass end piece.  Modernized style is anodozed gold instead of plain brass.","WW2 and prior Marines wore shell cordovan ankle-height shoes which were a dark purplish brown (used to be called &quot;oxblood&quot; back when it was still a common men's shoe color). \n\nThe class A greens, BTW, were actually a field uniform at the time. The Marines posted to Greenland in '41 stepped off the gangplank in woolen greens, overcoats and camnpaign covers. They also typically wore collar pins under their scarves (ties)!","What a beautiful mess we've made.","Wow!

Said climatologist Dr. David Gee, Chairman of the International Geological Congress, &quot;For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming?&quot; ----- Dr. Kunihiko, Chancellor of Japan's Institute of Science and Technology said this: &quot;CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or the other ... every scientist knows this, but it doesn't pay to say so.&quot; (John Tomlinson, Flint Journal, January 19, 2009) \n<a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/opinion/flint/index.ssf/2009/01/its_time_to_pray_for_global_wa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mlive.com/opinion/flint/index.ssf/2009/01/its_time_to...</a>","Nice, more propaganda boxes all over the art. :p","Questa foto è stata seleziona tra migliaia di immagini.\nTi invitiamo a postarla nel link sotto, per partecipare ad una gara.\nVai direttamente a questo link , copia il codice HTML (lo trovi sullo spigolo in alto a destra della tua foto cliccando sulla scritta CONDIVIDI) ed incolla tale codice alla gara.\nSarà comunque necessario registrarsi (pochi secondo....!!)\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1744262@N24/discuss/72157628104951594/\">www.flickr.com/groups/1744262@N24/discuss/72157628104951594/</a>\n\nCordialità dagli Admin del grupppo\n\n<b> You are welcome to enjoy our challenges\npartecipa ai nostri contest </b>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1744262@N24\"> <img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6161949236_5aed8d39a1_m.jpg \" />\n<b> ◕‿◕SONIAGALLERY◕‿◕CHALLENGE-SFIDE◕‿◕</b>\n<b> noi ti aspettiamo !!! we are waiting for you !!!</b></a>","It's a pleasure for us to use your picture in our article:\n<a href=\"http://firstlinepress.org/pedalare-forzatamente-contro-il-parkinson-ed-autismo-nei-bimbi-vissuti-nello-smog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">firstlinepress.org/pedalare-forzatamente-contro-il-parkin...</a>\n\nWrite us if you are happy for this","Modern clouds!\nA great capture!!!","Absolutely beautiful.

In 1974 I personally counted the growth rings on the stump of a 54 ft. circumference giant redwood cut down in Mendocino County by Georgia-Pacific, a corporation which has since left the county after logging off all the available redwoods from its lands. There were over 1540 countable rings on the big stump I counted, plus more years of growth in the center where the wood had rotted away over the centuries. I had to use a magnifying glass to clearly see and count some of the rings. Only a tiny percentage of the original 2,000,000 acres of Coast Redwood forest remains uncut. Forest protection activists have been trying to put the brakes on corporate liquidation logging for more than 30 years. Most people assume the remaining virgin redwoods have been saved, and are amazed that some people still think it's okay to cut them down for fancy decks and wall paneling. Redwood is not used for structural lumber. It's too expensive for that, because it's so rare. There's only one place in the world where the Sequioia sempervirens grows naturally, and I'm priveleged to live there. This photo has got me started, and I'm going to find that 1974 slide documenting the 1540 year old redwood and post it in my Flickr stream soon.","One word.....\r\n\r\n                                  'Amazing'!","Pioneers lived inside this tree which was burned out by a lightning strike.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/belleville/50876643/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/50876643_62b9ee625d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"DSC08668\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere, my family stands at the base of a large one\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/belleville/82578119/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/37/82578119_f20d675f1f_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"smDSC03778\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMost people will never get a chance to see these.

I explained that it had started to grow before Jesus was born and the kids buzzed with comments and questions. Every once in a while someone would ask me something about the tree. Towards the end of the year, I told them some fantastic tale and one of the boys said, &quot;yeah, yeah, we know, just like that tree in California that's older than God!&quot;","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwilsonphoto] The redwoods will grow nicely in Oregon too, although not to 300 feet inland near Portland. But certainly 200 to 300 feet in our coast range if they would plant them. Since they log big swaths of our coastal forests every half decade or so, maybe they should replant some areas with coast redwood, I've already seen a few sporadic spots along Hy. 26 where they planted a few giant sequoia.

If I understand correctly, the ribbon shown above the medal is upside down. It should be worn with 2 stars on top, 3 below. The medal of honor is no longer pinned to the tunic, as was the case when this medal was made.","Over 45 years ago, as a brand new 2nd Lieutenant, I exchanged salutes with a Major walking down the sidewalk at Aberdeen Proving Ground. As we approached one another, I noticed a light blue ribbon with small stars on his uniform. I gave him the sharpest salute I could. I'm sure that he forgot me after five paces. I still remember that moment.","Civilized Explorer is correct, the Medal of Honor ribbon is to be worn with the two stars above and three below. Additionally when the medal is worn today, it is usually worn on the blue silk ribbon with 13 stars, regardless if the recipient is wearing military dress or civilian clothing.","I remember in the '50's a guy in my tiny home town who had one of those. I was about 10, I guess, and fully in awe of him. He was a friendly dude, easy-going, and I believe he wore the rosette on special occasions--town meetings, like. He had been a tank commander in the Battle of the Bulge. I don't recall if I ever heard the story of how he won the medal. His name, I believe, was Gleason.\r\n\r\nI knew from my father what the medal meant.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/886872@N24/\">Medals &amp; Decorations</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Are there any active uniformed Medal of Honor winners?

Thanks for the comment!","The Medal of Honor is often INCORRECTLY identified as the &quot;Congressional&quot;. Take note that it is presented by the Commander in Chief of US military forces  and not by a senator or representative.","It isn't exactly incorrect to call it the Congressional Medal of Honor. The medal is given by the Dept. of Defense and is USUALLY presented by the President, but hasn't always been.\n\nThe medal was created on July 12,1862 when President Abraham Lincoln signed S.J.R. No. 82.\nIt read:\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause two thousand &quot;medals of honor&quot; to be prepared with suitable emblematic devices, and to direct that the same be presented, in the name of the Congress, to such non-commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities, during the present insurrection (Civil War).\n\nOn March 3,1863 offficers were also allowed to win the MoH.\n\nOn August 5,1958 the Congressional Medal of Honor Society was chartered by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nFor more info check out their website at <a href=\"http://www.cmohs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cmohs.org</a>","Pretty ridiculous how it's a pentagram.","And why is it ridiculous?","I am certain this medal is not about pentagrams or plots or secret societies. Those who wear it, I am told, do so to honor their brothers, who for any number of reasons, do not. I would hope that this glimpse of the MOH  might encourage the casual viewer to seek out and read the citation given to any of  the recipients.... got freedom? thank a veteran.","Great shot.","Alot has changed since this photo was taken.

Great picture/history.","The caption is incorrect. Although on Santa Fe tracks, it is a photo  a Union Pacific passenger train. The locomotive is a Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake MT-2 class, 4-8-2. The LA &amp; SL was owned by the UP. From looking at the enlarged TIFF image, the locomotive number is likely  #7850. This engine had the nickname ''Killer'' because three employees were killed while operating it at various times.","The houses remind me of the ones described in Zora Neale Hurston's book &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;","Houses like this were common in Southeast Texas and Lousianna into the 1980's.","This year's FEMA housing....","Can you really say &quot;negro&quot;?","I think you should be able to say &quot;negro,&quot; although I haven't actually heard it used in years. There might be some people offended by it (you can always find somebody who is offended by something) but it doesn't have the deadly taboo status of that other &quot;n word.&quot;","The only reason it says &quot;negro&quot; is because they are stating the original photographer's caption that was included with the photo when it was taken.","makes me want to cry.","It's still a lot like that in parts of north and north-central Florida, except now the impoverished migrant workers are Mexican.","the exposures on these images are incredible.","Wow, excellent Color","Wow, a Norwegian American in a Bunad","<a href=\"http://www.littlenorway.com/\">www.littlenorway.com/</a>","Didn't know they had a little Norway back then.

I feel like I have seen that face before...","Yes, Little Norway does exsist. It's set in some of the most beautiful countryside Wisconsin has to offer.  Norwegians began to arrive as early as 1830 to the area now known as Blue Mounds and Mt. Horeb Wis., Just as the Swiss to New Glarus and Monroe Wis.\r\n\r\nJan, you should visit the area. Faces like that are very common. Farming is a rough life. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to figure how the &quot;head gear&quot; could be &quot;late 1970s&quot; when the photo was taken in 1942?","Yes it is. I tend to trust LOC dating, but I remember both the colors and the pseudo random pattern as 70s fashion.  (As far as I can see, the pattern is made by coloring the same yarn with different colors?) Maybe that technique had a revival in Norway in the 70s?","Stunning quality of photograph.\r\n\r\nI recently shot an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sidkid/sets/72157603899229558/\" target=\"_new\">event</a> on reversal film (Fujichrome Provia), and was able to have it processed and scanned in a few hours. As a result, my shots were on Flickr so soon, most people who saw them assumed they were shot digitally.\r\n\r\nI pointed out that while digital is now up to an extremely high standard, film has been there &quot;for a few decades&quot;. But even I was stunned when I came across this photo from the early 1940s! \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the film would've been rather large in format and very low in sensitivity, and thus not as easy to work with, but the final quality is still astounding.","The face, oh so familiar.  I remember going to Little Norway with my grade school class in the 1950's.  Could he have been the guide???  Would my brain hold such a visual detail???","His eyes look so sad.","whomever it was that dug these out of the library of congress and posted them here on Flickr we owe you a debt of gratitude.  these images are american heirlooms that deserve to be seen and not just locked away in the vault until some researcher happens along. \n\nthank you","Fantastic portrait!!\nHe is not looking at the photographer, but at the viewer!","I live an hour from Willow Run and was once inside the factory(1990s).\r\nI know Ford Motor Company built Consolidated B-24 Liberator Bombers there at a astounding rate. I've read a fair amount of aviation and I don't recall hearing about transports being built in Willow Run. Tire looks right for a B-24 from pictures and youtube videos I just looked at.","so awesome","Wow, great!!

Ford built B-24's under contract from Consolidated Aircraft. Willow Run was and still is located just outside of Ypsilanti, Michigan. The assembly facility was owned and operated by Ford.","Armchair aviator:  Thank you for the information about the Willow Run facility. We will update the data and reload the description.","And yes, roderick, it does take three men. Maybe more. When I change a tire on an aircraft, it takes me and another to change it. Another to inspect it, and another to say the first inspector is right. It's all about checks and balances. Oh, and not killing people with faulty maintenance.","Is this the final paint color? Or just some kind of primer kote?","No, it's a zinc dichromate  primer.  On the interiors of it was often a pea green color.  Quite toxic I think , but good a protecting the metal.","This series of pictures are B-24 Bombers and I think at this point in the process, we are seeing the final color of that front cowling as it is called.\r\n\r\nLots of these planes went out the door with bare metal on the exterior parts.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong.","Greenhorns:\n         In all actuality, WWII planes' paint jobs final touch were often applied with &quot;Kilroy was here,&quot; or some such personalized, decompensating brush stroke.\n\n10-4, over and out.\n\nPete Moss\nmusicians, please to be making the noises, now.","Airplane Engines now replaced by Jet Engines..the latest news has been about &quot;missing parts&quot;..or installing &quot;broken&quot; parts..//??//War&amp;Peace.","Well, in this case a good alternative title would have been &quot;Chicks doing a bomber&quot;...\n\nWould have been kind cool to work in one of these factories with so many girls running around w/o a guy. ;)","wow! so what they always talked about in history class (women taking over industry jobs) really did happen to the scale which it was proclaimed to be! I now have been made a believer!","The Willow Run, Michigan location was a factory owned by Ford Motor Company, which built Consolidated B-24 'Liberators' under license. Ford's long experience with assembly line techniques meant that, according to mechanics who maintained them, the Ford-built B-24s tended to be a higher quality product than their Consolidated-built counterparts.\n\nThe yellow chromate primer seen here would have received an Olive Drab over Neutral Gray camouflage job; natural metal finish aircraft would not have carried this primer on the external surfaces.","About those engines . . . Most aircraft engines used in WWII were radials. That means there were odd numbers of cylinders in a circle. Usually 7 or 9. For heavy bombers the engine often had as many a 4 banks of cylinders stacked for totals up to 36 cylinders turning one propeller shaft. And that is only one of four engines. I once flew in a C97, which is the cargo version of the B29 bomber. The crew told me that aircraft was powered by 156 cylinders. The B24 engine is probably similar.","Great conservation state.

Why do we have dozens of contiguous shots of factories but just a single image of this world-historic moment?","Es una magnifica foto. El desfile de la Division Leclerc por el Paris liberado. En esta liberacion participaron miembros españoles de la division Leclerc, en la Novena Compañia. \nSirve de homenaje a los españoles que lucharon contra Hitler.","Interesting the way the label refers to them as &quot;French Patriots&quot;. As opposed to what other sort of French person at the end of an occupation.","Hello Mr. Flikker:  Thank you for your interest in this photograph. The majority of the United States Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information (FSA/OWI) photographs depict life in the United States. OWI probably acquired this image of Paris from an outside photographic source  and added it to their files. That is probably why the FSA/OWI collection does not contain more images of this event.","Small point: there is no &quot;roll&quot; as such. If you look at the photo, you will see, on the right and top and bottom, thick lines. These are the shadows of the plate holder, telling us that the picture was taken with a Graflex camera, perhaps a Speed Graphic, which was the premier press camera of the 30s-50s. As well, the corners of the shot are perfectly square. Slides taken on a 35mm roll will have rounded corners from the cardboard slide mount.\n\nWith the Graflex cameras, each shot was taken separately, with the plate holder and film pushed into the camera back together. The cover was then extracted separately and the picture taken, the cover put back in, and the exposed shot (properly covered) extracted. Doesn't make for fast work, but the 4&quot; x 5&quot; negatives hold something like 45 megapixels of information.","Wow!  This is a treasure!

Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry outperformed both competitors and more than met the Air Corps' expectations. Although Boeing lost the contract due to the prototype's crash, the Air Corps was so impressed with Boeing's design that they ordered 13 B-17s. The B-17 Flying Fortress went on to eventually evolve through numerous design advancements.\n\nThe B-17 was primarily employed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial, civilian, and military targets. The United States Eighth Air Force based in England and the Fifteenth Air Force based in Italy complemented the RAF Bomber Command's nighttime area bombing in Operation Pointblank, to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for Operation Overlord.[4] The B-17 also participated, to a lesser extent, in the War in the Pacific, where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1046032@N20/\">as beautiful as you want</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\nWonderful\nCompliments, I like it; Please add this photo to\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1046032@N20/\"> <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/buddyicons/1046032@N20.jpg?1239274945\" /> &quot;as beautiful as you want&quot; </a> group","I like the contrast between the peace and beauty of this scene, and what the thing she's working on is actually made for.","Beautiful Capture...i love the colours ....very nice","Really nice photo!","الحب","i disagree with the statement made about the b-17 as being sufficient in defending itself because of it's armament.the fact that 250,000 airmen were shot down in heavy bombers would tell you something. the reason they went on daylight bombing runs is because they could not find the target without bombing the surrouning country side. and the fact that they finnaly got escourt from the p-51 mustang is what saved thier butts. but it did take exessive damage and could still fly with tail and wing sections shot off. it was a great airplane. but the americans built so many of them that the luftwaffe could not keep up.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1218875@N22/\">Art' Flying Machines</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Buena toma\nsaludos","genial!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115426@N24/\">US Military II</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\n<a href=\"http://photobucket.com/images/usa flag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i118.photobucket.com/albums/o91/PhysOrg/Flag.gif\" alt=\"USA Flag Pictures, Images and Photos\" /></a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1125845@N20/\">United States Culture II</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Vrey Beautiful photo.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1196014@N24/\">inspired - exposures</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Great capture!","awsome!","Que bela fotografia !

The quality is so good that it's hard to believe it's such an old image","nice!","I'm sorry to report that this photo has been mislabeled, probably all the way back to its original publication. The women cannot be working on a Douglas C-47, because the type of engine shown was never used on the C-47. (Also its placement is wrong for a C-47 engine: it is mounted underneath the wing, while C-47s had their engines roughly centered in the wing.) Most likely they're working on a Douglas A-20 twin-engined bomber, which does match the engine and propeller type in the photo. Looking at the full resolution version available at the Library of Congress, the engine's data plate is readable enough to show that it is a R-2600 Cyclone 14 built by Wright Aeronautical. That is a bigger, more powerful engine than the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp which the C-47 used. The propeller blade specification can be read as an 6353A-21, also a type not used with the C-47. (The C-47 did use the 6353A-18, but that's a longer blade.) Both the engine and blade types match the A-20, which as far as I can tell was the only aircraft to use that blade type—hence I conclude this is an A-20.","See also this photo, taken at almost the same moment:\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179920874/]","Wow. Awesome picture!","nice. he looks like quite the character.","awesome portrait.","amazing!","Love the blue sky and detail on the propeller, I love the quality of this, will digital hold up this well for future viewers?","It's amazing how recent these prints appear to be.","Question is - what sort of aircraft is that behind him?  A-20? B-25? Something else?","based on it's sequence in this photostream, I'd guess it's a C-47","I believe it to be a C-47 Douglas cargo transport Plane. Yes","What I am wondering about is what kind of film was used and after doing some searching &quot; googled&quot; and on Wikipedia under Kodak film used in the 1942 time frame it was problbly Kodacrome or possibly Ektachrome. but I think really it was Kodacrome because as the article said Ektachrome was in the 1950's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ektachrome\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ektachrome</a>","I cannot say I can disagree, but that intake on the top is pretty far forward isn't it?  Every picture I've seen of a C-47 has had that intake further back.","B-25B.  The C-47 had a strut on either side of the wheel, while the B-25 had the strut inboard of the wheel.  Also, the C-47/DC-3 did not have landing gear bay doors (that dark rectangle just above the wheel)...the landing gear pivoted forward into the engine nacelle.  \r\n\r\nThe B-D model had the turbocharger intake lush with the lip of the cowling...Turbochargers on later models were located higher on the cowling and further aft.

But if you think this is good, try looking up the full-resolution version of the photo. The clarity goes from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;amazing&quot;, and yet there's no doubt when it was made. There's the kind of photo you're used to thinking of as typical for 1942, and then there's stuff like this. This is what you could achieve if you had access to the very highest quality of camera and film materials, which the photographers on this government project did. The film used for shots like this could be several inches across, which gives you an enormous amount of film grain (think of microscopic, somewhat randomly arranged analog &quot;pixels&quot;) to work with. Zoom in on a very high-resolution scan of an old top-quality photo like this and you'll see the analog &quot;noise&quot; from the film grain.\n\nI've seen photos just as sharp done in black and white from as far back as the *Wright Brothers* (think 1903), or even earlier. Again, the key is to have a skilled photographer with a really good camera, focused well, using enormous (and expensive!) film plates as big as a small sheet of paper. For really old photos, it also helps if the subject doesn't move much; otherwise details get smeared across the image because of the long exposure time needed. There are plenty of old sharp photos with such little smeared details where something like a flag or a cloud of steam was obviously shifting around.\n\nThe other catch was that photos like this had to be processed into slide transparencies and projected to see the full detail, because they couldn't be printed with anything like this degree of clarity. If we're lucky, the film plates, negatives, or slides were kept well preserved, so that we're now able to digitize them to get images like this. Other times we're not so lucky, and the chance for good modern images has been lost.","Rosie the Riveter has nothing on this woman!

When I was still young (but old enough to remember), he'd take me to work with him on occassion at the Brooklyn Ship Yards, where my father was on government contract. I remember seeing the huge ships that were under construction there- just as awesome as the photo above.\n\nIn later years we moved to Long Island, lived a stone's throw from Grumman's air filed and aircraft manufacturers; it was a common sight to see full scale plane construction of transport, and new jet planes rolling off the assembly line. It also served as a test field. We also lived close to the active military base at Mitchell Field, between Uniondale and Garden City/ Westbury, NY-  I visited these places and it was amazing to go in the hangers and see huge engines, huge transport planes, jets, and fighter planes on the tarmac, some of which rumbled the ground and broke the sound barrier over our homes! The mechanics we met would explain how critical their jobs were, in keeping the planes in shape, and ready to take flight at a moments notice.

I'm not certain, but I believe that this is a Kodachrome transparency. The lenses of the day were certainly capable of this sort of sharpness, and the lighting was most likely done with floods; strobes hadn't been invented and flash bulbs wouldn't have been an ideal solution. This photo was more than likely staged, as part of a &quot;photo shoot&quot; intended to generate photographs to encourage public support for the war effort.

A condition of the approval was the supply of two examples to the USAAC for evaluation and these two were delivered and given the designation XP-51. \nBefore that however the US army had already contracted for the procurement of 150 additional aircraft for supply to Britain under Lend-Lease designating these P-51 and these differed from the earlier version by having self sealing tanks and four wing mounted 20mm cannon in place of the eight machine guns. \nFrom this batch 93 were supplied to Britain, becoming designated Mustang IA, 55 went to the USAAF as F-6A's, equipped with two K-24 cameras for use in the tactical recon role and the remaining two also went to the USAAF with different engines, initially as XP-78's but later brought into the family as XP-51B's.\nThe designation of this aircraft in US service as P-51 came after North American opened the second plant at Dallas, Texas to increase production from the already stretched Inglewood plant which did not occur until 1943 and this image is dated October 1942. In the summer of 1943 the first P-51B is produced at Inglewood and the identical P-51C is produced from the Dallas plant, operationally their first mission in USAAF service was on Dec 13 1943 when elements of the 8th undertook a long range escort to Keil from the UK","I notice that the insignia on the aircraft is American not British.","An amazing aircraft.","p-51 = awesome i love this machine","bravo! fabulous","The P-51 in the photo is clearly an &quot;A&quot; model because it has the Allison engine with the carburetor air scoop on top of the spinner rather than underneath.

Sawdust was spread on canals and rivers which were close to enemy targets ,so as to dull the shine on moonlit nights.(enemy aircraft would follow the river up to the munitions/aircraft factory).\nEfforts would be made to make an area of wasteland/ open fields appear to be the target , using balsa wood &quot;buildings&quot; and using burning -oil barrels to mark a false riverbank, or false aircraft runway.\nWorked, a lot of the time.","Great and informative. \n\nHi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1239139@N20/\">People love their Work</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","<b>This Photo is Brilliant!</b>\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/michaeladdison/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4800035832_ec8be652f6_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"this photo is brilliant!\" /></a> \n\n Mike","Hi, we are using temporarily, your photo\non <a href=\"http://www.automotivespace.it/eng/the-interviews/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.automotivespace.it/eng/the-interviews/</a>\n\nMany Thanks","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/28079146@N07] \n\nIn Britain I believe they had pipe systems (called &quot;starfish&quot; or &quot;Q decoys&quot;) with oil and gas decoys in empty fields near some important targets and towns.\nThe idea was everything was blacked out, but the oil ad gas systems would be ignited and appear to be a burning target (e.g a burning factory or airfield or whatever) then the next wave of bombers would bomb the decoy which would be clearly visible and easy to aim for.\n\nSee <a href=\"http://www.portsdown-tunnels.org.uk/surface_sites/qsite_p1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.portsdown-tunnels.org.uk/surface_sites/qsite_p1.html</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_site\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_site</a> for details.","Yeah,jtan163 that's exactly what they did.Happened around Trafford Park, a big industrial complex near Manchester.My Dad was on firewatch there during the war.The place was surrounded by farmland and mossy bogland and they used Q decoys to good effect there, :-)","This must be how the camouflage for the Boeing production facilities in Seattle was created.

The prevailing winds from the west and southwest deposited tons of soot over the immediate vicinity. More than once, traffic on Highway 80 (now I-20) west of Odessa came to a stop when the black clouds rolled out over the highway on the rare occasion of no wind. The black clouds did not come out of a smokestack but billowed out of the large buildings. The man in the photo has a white powder on his face, but look at his neck and clothes. He worked in those clouds. Another danger in those plants was from hydrogen-sulfide, the odorless, invisible gas that can kill a human in a matter of seconds. It was the hydrogen-sulfide in the natural gas that was a key component of the carbon black process and the West Texas oil and natural gas wells produce massive volumes of &quot;sour&quot; gas.

So far, no country except Ethiopia has recognized Somaliland, though there are rumors that recognition may be comming.\n\n Note also that Burma (Myanmar) is part of British India. This may be an old map, I think the British had seperated Burma by this time (though independence did not come until the late 1940's.)

I feel for these women, and this photo makes the entire situation more real.  \n\nI'm a little disturbed, however, that this would be compared to Nazi Germany - were we trying to exterminate an entire race?  Were we killing Japanese people - cooking them in ovens, or with chemical showers, starving them to death and performing medical experiments on them?  No, of course not!  \n\nIt was obviously a horribly shameful overreaction by the American government, and an error that I'm sure we all hope never to see repeated, but I think the comparison to Nazi Germany is off base.","I believe the comparisons people have made end at the fact that our government with our blessings isolated undesirable members of our society, took their property, separated them from their own families, and then placed them in camps. There's never been a sensible accusation that we did more than that to these people; but it shouldn't have happened at all.","I didn't make a comparison, in fact i made a contrast, the upswing of what I said was that the US went through the trouble of a propaganda campaign to create the impression that these people were happy to be rounded up into detention camps, and the germans made no such attempt at showing how happy the jews &amp; etc. they rounded up were, being set free through work and all.","I don't want to get into the whole &quot;compare/contrast&quot; thing here... but\n@Romulusnr - The Nazis DID have certain camps where they had the &quot;nice parts&quot; that they could take photos of, and give tours of, etc. They weren't necessarily <i>actually</i> nice for the people interned, but they had their own &quot;smiling girls&quot;-type propaganda for sure.","where's the space sheriff gavan?","great shot","This photo tells a story to all who look at it.","This is a sad time in American history - almost like a concentration camp (minus the gas).\n\nThese poor women have to wear light white make up and still deal with intense of racial persecution.","awesome","This image has been used in the indicommons.org post: <a href=\"http://www.indicommons.org/2009/01/16/flickring-across-the-library-of-congress/\">Flickring across the Library of Congress</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://indicommons.org/\"><img src=\"http://indicommons.org/images/indicommonsURL.png\" alt=\"indicommons.org badge\" /></a>","It's easy to look at stuff like this through he lens of modern interpretation.

Here goes...\n\nIt's easy to judge from where we are now, but put yourself in the shoes of the average American circa 1942 when this photo was taken. On December 7th, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. It wasn't a group of radicals or terrorists or extremists, it was Japan. The country. Specifically Japan's Navy, by order of the Emperor himself. On top of that, it was a sneak attack. Through a bungle in communication, it was not seen as a lawful and somewhat &quot;understandable&quot; act of war as intended, but as an evil, vicious, and unprovoked attack that KILLED about 2400 Americans in a few short moments. Over 1100 men died on in the Arizona; most drowned. They're still down there today. The American public was very angry, and very afraid. Fear is a very powerful motivator, and it makes people irrational. Just look at the &quot;bomb scare&quot; incident in Boston in 2007.\n\nAs someone else said above, in 1942 we weren't quite the melting pot we are today, or at the very least, the various cultures of the people of this country weren't nearly as integrated as they are now. As a result, the government reacted in the way it did, mostly out of fear, and I don't blame them for a second. I realize the absurdity of this question, but what would you have done differently? What if the decisions were up to you? What if you have reliable information that said there will be another major attack from within the country? What do you do? Wait for it to happen? How do you protect your people while not infringing upon their rights? Contrary to popular belief, the American government does not set out each day to oppress and/or ruin the lives of it's citizens, no matter what their ethnicity may be, and I'm sure that the INTENT of the interment camps was no different. The results may have strayed, but I still don't blame them. While it's true that the vast majority of Japanese Americans were completely law-abiding upstanding citizens, the FEAR that saboteurs were among them was enough to &quot;require&quot; the camps, and please don't forget that the general public was absolutely in support of not only the camps, but going to war itself, and of using the atomic bombs. Do not be a victim of selective memory. It's not as if there was public outrage at all of this. Nobody lined the streets in protest. No one.\n\nWhile I and everyone else here NOW see that the camps were a mistake, we have the benefit of 50+ years of hindsight. Think about that for a second. 50 years before WWII, people legally kept slaves in this country. SLAVES!! Something else to think about... what happened to Americans in Japan during all of this? Were they put in camps? Or were they killed? Read about Japan's actions in WWII. Since someone remarked above about Guantanamo Bay, what happens to Americans in Iraq or Afghanistan these days? I don't know about you, but I would much rather live in a prison cell or interment camp than have my head cut off and my body burned in the streets. I'm NOT excusing the government or it's actions, I'm just trying to remind everyone to keep things in perspective.\n\nI'm not a republican or a Bush fan in particular, but if he asked the American public in July of 2001 for its approval to deploy a few thousand soldiers to go capture a bad guy named Osama Bin Laden, everyone would have said &quot;Absolutely not! He's all the way over there in Afghanistan! What can he do!?&quot;. If there was a proposal in 1999 to raise taxes to create a better airport security network, everyone would have said &quot;No way! What's the point?&quot; No one wants to do the dirty work or make sacrifices to be safe and free, they just want to be safe and free. Unfortunately, the world does not work that way. That's not America's fault.\n\nBy all means, question the government! Be a good citizen! Keep them honest! I absolutely support that! This is America, and we're SUPPOSED to do that! But don't expect them to never make a mistake. Don't expect them to be perfect. And don't judge them too harshly out of context 50 years after the fact (that goes for Japan too!). Expect them only to do the best they can with what they know, because that's all anyone can do. \n\nSorry for the rant...","<i>&quot;I'm not a republican or a Bush fan in particular, but if he asked the American public in July of 2001 for its approval to deploy a few thousand soldiers to go capture a bad guy named Osama Bin Laden, everyone would have said &quot;Absolutely not!

What can he do!?&quot;</i>\n\nyou're wrong. lots of people would have agreed to that.\n\nthe more interventionist democrats on the left, because of the taliban's repressive policies toward women. in the late nineties there were many emails flying around liberal circles about these problems. also, the taliban blew up thousand year old buddhas of bamiyan which drew worldwide attention and condemnations from liberals.\n\non the right, the bombing of the USS Cole by al-queda in october 2000, killing 17 US servicemen, was viewed as tantamount to a declaration of war.\n\nso you're wrong. in july 2001 if bush had really wanted to take a few thousand soldiers and invade afghanistan there would have been a lot of support for the action from both the interventionist left and the militarist right. there'd have been more opposition than there was after september 11, but greater rationale for an attack as there was in going into the former yugoslavia, seeing as that al-queda had already launched an unprovoked attack against US armed forces.\n\nbtw, i'm tempted to go back into this comment and CAPITALIZE some RANDOM words for EFFECT.\n\nalso - you're condemning people for their selective memory while being awfully selective yourself. german U-Boats were landing german agents on the eastern seaboard of the US to run sabotage missions, laid mines in new york harbour and had sunk hundreds of ships, killing over 2000 people.\n\nyet no policy of interment for german americans was ever instituted. this was at the <i>exact same time</i> that japanese americans were being rounded up and forcibly evicted from their jobs and homes. are we seriously to believe that there was no out-and-out <b>racism</b> involved in this transparently obvious double standard?\n\nit is one thing to say that the united states should have known better, but it is another thing to see that, based on events happening <i>at the time</i>, that they indeed <b>did</b> know better - at least when it came to german americans.","&quot;Lots of people&quot; isn't the American public, or Congressional approval, or popularity polls, which have become the yardstick by which the merits of a President are measured - popularity and public approval ratings. Worldwide condemnation and $10 will buy you a movie ticket these days. It doesn't push troops into battle. It doesn't make the gears turn to get things moving. &quot;Lots of people&quot; think what they see on Fox News is the whole story, and &quot;lots of people&quot; voted for John McCain. Unless &quot;lots of people&quot; is a majority vote, it's nothing. So you're wrong.\n\nAlso, you're confusing attacks on US interests as attacks on US soil. There's a difference. German U-boats sinking hundreds of trans-Atlantic ships over the years and planting agents in the USA is tantamount to Bin Laden blowing up embassies over the years and the Taliban destroying statues and treating women poorly. What do we do? We condemn it. We don't act, we say words. Big mean words. We rattle our saber. We wait for the UN to do something. The USS Cole was a military ship operating in hostile waters. It was not American civilians leaping to their deaths on live TV. It was not hijacked commercial flights full of moms and dads and kids disappearing into the side of a building in downtown NYC. \n\nJapan's Navy, acting on orders from Japan's leaders, invaded U.S. territory with a force consisting of 6 carriers and 353 aircraft and attacked a U.S. naval base. They sunk 4 battleships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and sunk or damaged 3 cruisers, 3 destroyers, and 1 minelayer. They killed thousands of people in a few short minutes on American soil, just like Al-Qaeda did on 9/11. Germany never launched a direct assault on America, nor did they inflict nearly the amount of damage or loss of life in a single attack on a U.S. interest. There's a difference. By the way, I'm sure &quot;lots of people&quot; wanted us to go to war after the Lusitania, but what did we do? Nothing. We let our allies in Europe slog it out with Germany for years, and I'm sure &quot;lots of people&quot; wanted us to help them fight, but what did we do? Nothing. &quot;Sorry guys, we're gonna sit this one out. Good luck though.&quot; We did our best to stay out of it until we were attacked by Japan.\n\n19 American soldiers died in Mogadishu in 1993 going after a bad guy that wasn't front page news, and therefore not worth the risk in the eyes of the American public. The men on the ground didn't get AC-130 gunship support which would have been virtually invulnerable in that situation, all because Clinton didn't want it to be a &quot;high profile&quot; operation. Why? Popularity polls. To the president, &quot;lots of people&quot; is the same thing as &quot;lots of voters&quot;. Americans are outraged at going after Saddam, even though he killed 35,000 of his own people and allegedly had more of the same chemical weapons, aka WMDs. But they weren't Americans he killed, right? And he didn't use the WMDs on us yet, right? So who cares? It must just be about oil, I guess...\n\nThe catch 22 of unconventional warfare is that the average citizen never hears about the successes, only the failures. The modern American public wants results without sacrifice, but that's not the kind of world we live in. The president has to make decisions every day that put men and women in harm's way and will be scrutinized for years and years to come. People will frown upon the A-bomb and interment camps and GITMO and Mogadishu and Viet Nam and the Bay of Pigs for centuries, but if you have a better solution, by all means, propose one.\n\nIt's December 8th, 1941 - Pearl Harbor is still burning, there are some 2000 bodies tallied so far and more still in the water, and there are doomed sailors trapped and still alive in the Arizona, tapping on the hull and waiting for a rescue that will never come, all from a sneak attack by Japan's Navy. You're FDR... what do you do? \n\nBy the way, I'm tempted to go back into this comment to <b>boldface</b> and <i>italicize</i> some <b>random</b> words for <b><i>effect</i></b>. Apparently it's cool as long as you use html.","<i>&quot;Lots of people&quot; isn't the American public, or Congressional approval, or popularity polls, which have become the yardstick by which the merits of a President are measured&quot;</i>\n\nthere was at least as much rationale as the clinton administration used in attacking miloscevic. not *every* american war has needed a 9/11 or pearl harbor to kick it off. check your selective memory.\n\n<i>&quot;German U-boats sinking hundreds of trans-Atlantic ships over the years and planting agents in the USA&quot;</i>\n\nactually over 2000 people in only 6 months, in what has been referred to as the pearl harbor of the atlantic. not &quot;over the years&quot;. do some research beyond endlessly repeating how awful pearl harbor was. it was awful. so were a lot of other things that happened in that time.\n\n<i>&quot;Germany never launched a direct assault on America&quot;</i>\n\nhawaii wasn't a state yet. the level level of atrocities on both sides of the atlantic and the outset of america's involvement in the war were extremely comparable. there were sailor's bodies, killed by german u-boats, washing up on the eastern seaboard of the mainland united states.\n\n<i>&quot;You're FDR... what do you do?&quot;</i>\n\nexactly what he did do with the german-american citizens. essentially nothing. what happened with the forced detainment of american citizens was unconstitutional and fundamentally immoral. it was driven by racism and was not a simple mistake, something easily forgivable in the fog of war.\n\nplenty of sailors and civilians died gruesome, excruciating deaths in the atlantic, that wouldn't have excused or provided a rationale for the forced detainment of patriotic german-americans either.\n\nin the here-and-now, we have fortunately learned some lessons from this sad chapter in american history. after 9/11,  the bush administration did make a very concerted effort to try to let the american public know that they should not blame or persecute all muslims or arabs in response to the attacks. while these warnings were not heeded by all americans, and many other mistakes were made, i believe that it was at least in part due to lessons learned from the internment debacle that the administration chose this posture.","romulusnr - Sorry, but not in <em>any</em> cases were \n&quot;people who happened to just 'look' Japanese&quot; \nrounded up and placed in the internment camps \nThat simply did not happen --\n\nThat is <em>not</em> to say that many Asian-Americans did not face prejudice, unjustified anger and persecution from others at the time, as many people &quot;mistook&quot;

-\nPeople just couldn't seem to get it through their heads that \nthe Japanese-Americans really <em>wanted</em> to be just as \n&quot;American&quot; as anyone else, that the US was now their adopted country, and that they were loyal to what was now their new homeland, and not to the government back in the &quot;Old Country&quot; ---\n\nA lot of this misconception did come about because of the stereotypes of Asian-Americans that were perpetrated in the popular culture of the day - ( Movies, Radio, pulp fiction, etc -)\nwhere &quot;Oriental Villains&quot; were sadistic, cunning and cruel, \n&quot;Inscrutable&quot; Chinese people always quoted from Confucious and said things like:\n&quot;Honorable Sir&quot; &amp; etc  - but also mainly where Asians were treated in general like some sort of otherwordly, mysterious and exotic race...\n\nAnd because there were simply <em>not</em> as many Asians living in the country at the time ( due, in great deal, to the exclusionary immigration laws that had been put in place years before, with the express purpose of severely limiting the number of Asians who could even enter the country to a bare minimum )\nmany average Americans throughout much of the country never even came into contact with real-live Asians, so they got their ideas about what Asians were all about from these sensationalized sources...\n\nAnyway, in the general public's mind's eye ( at the start of WWII )\nA lot of people just couldn't comprehend that all the \nJapanese-American citizens now in our country were not all going to be rushing down into their basements, getting on their short-wave radio sets and sending secret code messages back to Japan\nfilled with vital information for the Japanese Military --\nThe whole thing is stupid and absurd, of course,  \nbut I think that was the prevailing mentality at the time -\n( &quot;...Paranoia runs deep...Into your life it will creep...&quot; )\n\nAnd that is not to say, either, that their weren't those who didn't take huge unfair advantages of the situation when the Japanese-Americans were being rounded up and evacuated to the camps -\nStealing property &amp; taking businesses, and so on...\n\nOf course the smiles are all forced - they were never happy to be there, \nof course - it was a trial of humilation and great sorrow for them...\nBut no, the internment camps were <em>not</em> Auschwitz or \nDachau, either, they were not death camps, even if they were\nconcentration camps, there was no torture going on, no gruesome and horrible medical &quot;experiments&quot;, &amp; no starvation or slave labor, etcetera...\n\nAnd there were also a prevailing attitude among many of the Japanese-Americans in the camps that they had no choice but to to &quot;grin and bear it&quot; - to make the best of a lousy situation,  simply in order ( if nothing else ) to maintain sanity and self-respect, so they continued to have interests and keep themselves occupied, to keep up at least a &quot;sense of normalcy&quot; in their day-to-day lives, and to maintain a sense of community inside the confines of the camp, although of course they must have bitterly resented being ostracized from society at large -\nmore than anything, I believe they felt deeply hurt, and betrayed \nby what the government had done to them...\n\nAlso, yes, the Nazis did use this kind of propaganda when showing the outside world their lies about just how the Jews were being treated in their camps - in fact, they went a great deal further than this, they once set up an entire phony village-like enclave, filled it with\n&quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; Jews, and filmed their little propaganda film to show that this what was the way the Jews were being treated - like they had all been sent off to resort communities, ( &quot;Seperate, but Equal&quot; ) when, of course, the truth was 180 degrees in the opposite direction...\n\nI'm not sure if we really learned enough from the mistakes of the \n1940's, however - witness, in the aftermath of 9/11, close to a hysteria against Americans who ethnic background was from the \nNear East - sporadic hate crimes, and, again, on account of \n&quot;unfamiliarity&quot; with other peoples and cultures, the lumping together of many different kinds of people from different countries and different cultures into the same bag -\nAn obvious example being the hate-motivated attacks that came against Americans who came from the Indian Sikh tradition - their traditional turbans being confused with the kind worn by one \nMr Osama Bin Ladn...\n\nI also believe many Americans came under the false impression that in all the Muslim mosques all over the country, there were plots against America being hatched, and that they were all, ( more likely than not ) in league with, and reporting to the terrorists &quot;back home&quot;\n( in the same way people had that cock-eyed idea about the \nJapanese Americans doing the same back in WWII ) --\n\nI think just maybe, if there had not been the concerted effort , previously, to bring to light the injustice and just plain wrongness of the Internment Camps of WWII, there might have been a move \n( after 9/11) to start talking in terms of &quot;rounding up&quot; vast numbers of Americans of the Muslim faith and/or with Near-Eastern backgrounds and &quot;evacuating&quot; them to &quot;Internment Camps&quot; ? I believe we came a lot closer to a situation at least along those lines than we like to admit, in the aftermath of the horrible shock of 9/11, and in the confusion, panic and fear, \nno matter what Mr Bush may have been saying at the time abou thow  it was not right to &quot;single out&quot; Muslim-Americans and Americans who had immigrated from the Near-East ...=","Missing is the fact that the Japanese culture was such that all Japanese people, no matter where they were located, were expected to be true to the Emperor and do as directed and if they did not comply, the rulers would simply assassinate family members in Japan until they complied. Basically with the brutal culture that existed at the time, all the Japanese residents in the US would eventually either have had to take action against the US as directed or suffer the loss of family members in Japan. The people were in a very difficult situation. The decision to isolate the Japanese families in the US was done for the protection of the family members.  If the people could not be contacted through the ‘messengers’ already in the US, they could not be identified as refusing the Emperor.  Many of the people in the camps understood the problem very clearly.  The recommendation to form the camps came out of the Department of the Navy, interestingly enough, and was brought to the President by a man named Fluke.  The people in camps saved untold numbers of their own family members as the lives of untold US private citizens. One of the reasons the pictures generally show happy people….because they were because they understood the reasons.  This information was published rather widely in the late 40’s after the war was over but somehow seems to have disappeared from the discussions.  Failure to isolate the people in a timely fashion would have been a travesty.","the Japanese here are  lucky....the Asian women and european women in Japanese camps were abused and used as sex slaves...my mothers school friend was kept as a sex slave became pregnant  to the Japanese officer  he committed suicide when they were defeated.......the men in prison camps were beaten starved and murdered and worked until they dropped....\nthe Japanese in the USA were OK thank you ....that is why they smile here","They look pretty happy for having their basic human rights violated...","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/brennerdc] \n\nYou obviously understood:\n\n&quot;  think that Madktdisease was saying that up until this photo, she had been viewing the whole set with nostalgia for how things used to be.

These were their family photos, not conscious documentation of the injustice they were living under.\n\nmuI think the daily life they built in the camps, which was filled with a lot of pretty &quot;normal&quot; activities like employment and pastimes, didn't leave much time for sitting around and looking miserable over the hardships and fundamental betrayal dealt them by the U.S. government.\n\nAlso, photography by incarcerees was officially banned in the camps though the restriction was eventually relaxed. This undoubtedly caused a lot of negative sights to be hidden from cameras.

There was no information that might have come out of the Monadnock Region that could have been of the slightest interest to our enemies, and it's extremely doubtful that light signals from Temple (elevation 2085 ft.) would be visible on the coast (roughly 65 mi. away), even on the region's rare clear nights.","The story was about lights from a Monadnock area mountain which could be seen at sea during WWI.  The popular explanation was German spies signalling U-boats, but the reality was some sort of experiment in photonics.","I know this view well, having walked up Pine Mtn many times.

It is bordered by Kotgalla to the north, enchanting Stream Nandhar and Shahrah-e-Raisham (Silk Route) to the east, Shingli Payeen to the south, Pine Forest (Nakhtaro Jungle) to the south-west and Landai - Kala Dhaka to the west. My great grandfather, Syed Pir Saadat Shah had six sons - Syed Pir Imam Shah, Syed Muhammad Issa Shah, Syed Maazuddin Shah, Syed Sirajuddin Shah, Syed Ruknuddin Shah and Syed Muhammad Ayaz Shah. First three sons, Syed Pir Imam Shah, Syed Muhammad Issa Shah and Syed Maazuddin Shah, who were from his Doadal wife, settled in Oghaz Banda and Landai, while Syed Sirajuddin Shah, Syed Ruknuddin Shah and Syed Muhammad Ayaz Shah, who were from his Turk-wife, settled in Chinar Kot, Singal Kot and Lami, etc. My village consists of four parts. The first one called “Poray Cham” which is situated to the south of the village, the second called “Barra Cham,” situated to the west and the third called “Kaar,” situated to the southwest and the fourth one called “Manzanay Kalay,” is the centre of the village. Besides, there are some colonies adjacent to my village, called Poray Shar, Kata Shar, Shagai and Khan Barai. My village has been blessed with a large number of natural springs, which have beautified it further. Well-known among them are: Chinar Cheena, Jarray Cheena, Tangwano Cheena, Khatsar Cheena, Sorro Cheena, Shar Cheena, Nakhtaro Cheena, Jabrai Cheena, Walla Cheena, Bodar Cheena and Gudar Cheena. All the people of my village use the water of these natural springs and enjoy their lives. Cheenar Spring is very popular which has a big maple tree adjacent to it. People sit under the ample shade of maple tree, drink cold water (chilled water) of the natural spring and spend their daytime in summer season. A cemented floor has been made under the shade of maple tree, which is used as “Ja-e- Namaaz” by the people of my village. Tangwano Cheena is very important and all the people take bath in this cheena (spring). We’re proud of all these natural springs of our village. There are five well-known big boulders (stones) in the surroundings of my village. These are known as Singlawano Gat, Kharro Gat, Gungay Gat, Tereh Gat and Baghrai Gutt. These boulders are the biggest ones in Battagram. We use to sit on these boulders and enjoy ourselves. We’re also very proud of having these big boulders in our village. There are three well-known small streams (tangey) in the surroundings of my village. These small streams are known as Bulbul Tangay, Tangwano Tangay and Cheenar Tangay. These small streams also fulfill the requirements of water for the agriculture of my village. Neekeh Gatta (Dady Stone) is also one of the scenic points of my village. People sit on it and enjoy themselves by viewing the beautiful natural scene of lush green fields. Unfortunately, this stone was removed at the time of construction of road to our village. People still do go to its site and enjoy themselves by breathtaking view of the surroundings grassy fields. The Pine Jungle, situated to the southwest of my village, has a great attraction. The tall pine trees, their waving leaves and branches look very beautiful. We sit under the shade of these pine trees in summer season. We also eat the fruits produced from cones (shintai) of pine trees. My village has the privilege to have such a beautiful forest of pine trees adjacent to it. My village has also the privilege of having a direct link through bridge with Shahrah-e-Raisham that connects Pakistan with China via Khanjrab Pass. This bridge is called ‘Japan Bridge’ which has been constructed over Stream Nandhar with the collaboration of government of Japan. This bridge has made my village a well-known and popular one in the whole district of Battagram. “Khat Sar” situated to the northeast of my village is also a popular scenic spot. People come to it and enjoy the eye-catching view of the beautiful natural scene of Stream Nandhar. We often take rest and spend most of our leisure time at Khat Sar. People also take picture of the beautiful scene of Stream Nandhar from Khat Sar. My village has a beautiful mosque in the centre of it. It looks very beautiful from everywhere. This mosque has a small Islamic Madrassa and a beautiful place of ablution (wazo khana) adjacent to it. Our village “Hujra” is situated to the east of the mosque. People pass their leisure time in this Hujra. This is also used as a combined guesthouse for the whole village. There are several meadows (Charagaah) to the west and North West of my village. People send their cattle to these meadows for grazing, which come back in the evening. Among these meadows, important ones are - Kaareen, Kuzzay Mattay, Barray Mattay and Chowgai. These are very fertile lands and people should utilize them for agricultural purposes. May God give courage to the people of my village to construct houses at these lands for themselves and make proper use of them. Amin! My village has also some well-known graveyards in the surroundings of it. These are called Landai Baba Graveyard, Jangrai Baba Graveyard, Paacha Baba Graveyard, Mulyano Baqbara and Spedaar Baba Graveyard, Khatsar Ziarat, Abai Ziarat and Haji Baba Ziarat. All our forefathers have been buried at these graveyards. People visit these graveyards to pray for their loved ones. May Almighty Allah grant His eternal peace to all of them. Amin! There are some spots of “rest” between my village and Landai. At these spots, people take rest for some time and get them-selves relaxed when they are under any stress. Among these rest spots, Proat Inzar, Damma, Ona ( ), Kharo Gut and Kandao are important ones. My village has the honour to have produced genius, educated, hospitable and hardworking people. It is matchless in education as compared to other villages of the area. My village has proud people. It has a large number of Haafiz-e-Quran, ulema, doctors, engineers, masters of Science, theology, business administration and computer, etc. They are very industrious and earn their living by the sweat of their brows. It has peace-loving people who want to enjoy cordial, peaceful, harmonious and friendly relations with all their neighbors. When the people of Kala Daka (Black Mountain) used to go to Battagram for shopping, on their way back, they used to spend their nights in the mosque of our village. They were used to feed by the people of my village. So my village was very popular for hospitality in the area. I love all these places from the core of my heart. I have been born, bred and spent most of the time of my childhood at these places. When I am sleeping, I always dream of these sites. When I am alone, these places are with me. My village is more than Kashmir to me. All people love it very much. My village was set ablaze by our archrival neighbours and the people were exiled in 1948. But by the grace of Al-Mighty Allah, we came back after an exile of four years. We built it once again. But unfortunately, its 85% population was devastated by severe earthquake at 8.52 (am), Saturday, 4th Ramazanul Mubarak-1426 A.H., 8th October 2005. May Allah protect my lovely village from all future dangers.

Also, air powered machines normally have a quick disconnect on the hose-machine link and the hose should be larger O.D.\nJust my 2 cents.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/8487951@N05] \n\nThe quick disconnect is on the other side of the tube, which can be seen as the air hose rises behind her.\n\nHere's a photo of another riveter, this one with a quick disconnect at the tool, which has a hose with a similar diameter.\n<a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/fsac/1a34000/1a34900/1a34953v.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/fsac/1a34000/1a34900/1a34953v.jpg</a>","Hamsta180, I cannot agree. The hose on the machine which you provide the link is much larger, and that is, an air hose.\nBut the discussion lead to a very nice picture that is the benefit :)","Its electric - the vents in the housing are for cooling the electric motor, typically a small fan on the end of the motor shaft behind those vents. \n\nShe is likely drilling - counter-sinking the holes for flush rivets. Although there are rivet driver attachments for drills, in a factory setting they would probably have used an air-driven rivet hammer tool.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lamidesign] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/8487951@N05] Alright, I concede, I guess you guys are right about it being electrical.","I went back and forth on it because you were right about the size of the cord etc. Its only because the air hose in the background looks red, and the chord at the drill looks black that I changed my mind.","These old windings from WWII had a specific smell when operated, coupled with the Bakelite.

We will look into it.","This is an early version of the P-51. The full glass canopy wasn't until a later iteration (the P-51D). Details can be found here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang</a>.","From Warbird Alley <a href=\"http://www.warbirdalley.com/p51.htm\">www.warbirdalley.com/p51.htm</a>\r\n\r\nHistory: One of the most effective, famous and beautiful fighter aircraft of WWII, the P-51 was designed to fulfill a British requirement dated April 1940. Because of the rapidly-mounting clouds of war in Europe, the UK asked North American Aircraft to design and build a new fighter in only 120 days. The NA-73X prototype was produced in record time, but did not fly until 26 October 1940. The first RAF production models, designated Mustang Mk Is, underwent rigorous testing and evaluation, and it was found that the 1,100-hp Allison engine was well suited for low-altitude tactical reconnaissance, but the engine's power decreased dramatically above an altitude of 12,000 feet, making it a poor choice for air-to-air combat or interception roles. Because of this, the RAF left its eight machine guns intact, but also fitted the Mustang with cameras. In this configuration, it served in at least 23 RAF squadrons, beginning in April 1942.\r\n\r\nThe first Merlin-engine versions appeared in 1943 with the P-51B, of which 1,988 were built in Inglewood, California, and the P-51C, of which 1,750 were built in Dallas, Texas. Both new versions had strengthened fuselages and four wing-mounted 12.7-mm machine guns. Many of these new Mustangs were delivered to the UK as Mustang Mk IIIs, and others went to the USAAF as F-6Cs.\r\n\r\nMore info on the site...","I'll expand on why this is a F-6A:\r\nThe production of the NA73 design for the UK had to receive the blessing of the US government before  it could become ratified. A condition of the approval was the supply of two examples to the USAAC for evaluation and these two were delivered and given the designation XP-51. Before that however the US army had already contracted for the procurement of 150 additional aircraft for supply to Britain under Lend-Lease designating these P-51 and these differed from the earlier version by having self sealing tanks and four wing mounted 20mm cannon in place of the eight machine guns. From this batch 93 were supplied to Britain, becoming designated Mustang IA, 55 went to the USAAF as F-6A's, equipped with two K-24 cameras for use in the tactical recon role and the remaining two also went to the USAAF with different engines, initially as XP-78's but later brought into the family as XP-51B's.\r\nThe designation of this aircraft in US service as P-51 came after North American opened the second plant at Dallas, Texas to increase production from the already stretched Inglewood plant which did not occur until 1943 and this image is dated October 1942. In the summer of 1943 the first  P-51B is produced at Inglewood and the identical P-51C is produced from the Dallas plant, operationally their first mission in USAAF service was on Dec 13 1943 when elements of the 8th undertook a long range escort to Keil from the UK","Would question the title of this photograph - the US supplied other aircraft for RAF use (or at least evaluation).  Before the P-51, the Curtiss-Wright P40A-C Tomahawk was issued (not used in frontline combat), and the P40D-F Warhawk was issued under the name Kittyhawk.  <a href=\"http://www.nzwarbirds.org.nz/p40a.html\">This website</a> gives a comprehensive history.","I question the title also.  The RAF used the Douglas A-20, Catalina, even B-17s.","The RAF used the North American Mustang I, IA, and II in a tactical reconnaissance role. The RAF Mustang I was armed with 4 Browning .50 calibre and 4 Browning .30 calibre machine guns. The Mustang IA was equipped with 4 Hispano MkII 20mm cannon and the Mustang II had 4 Browning .50 calibre machine guns.\n\nThe RAF Mustang III was used in a fighter role and was equipped with 4 Browning .50 calibre machine guns.\n\nThe RAF reorganised in 1943 in preparation for the opening of the second front in Europe and used the lessons learned from its operations in North Africa with the 1st Tactical Air Force - The Desert Air Force.  A 2nd Tactical Air Force was formed during the summer of 1943 and the RAF's 2 Group from Bomber Command, which encompassed all the light  twin engined daylight bombers, were all moved under the control of Fighter Command and then into the 2nd TAF.  The bomber types moved into the TAF were North American Mitchell II, and III, Douglas Boston III, IIIA, IV and V, Lockheed Ventura I, and II,and De Havilland Mosquito FBVI.  As can been seen the majority of these types of aircraft were supplied to the RAF under the lend-lease scheme with the exception of the British Mosquito.","If you follow the trackback to the LOC original and download it, what you find is that the negative is a 4&quot; x 5&quot;, and thus most likely shot on a Graflex press camera of some sort (you can see the film plate holder outlines on the left and top and bottom). The LOC scanners set their resolution at 1500dpi, capturing roughly 45 megapixels of information. What's amazing about that is that at 100% magnification, you are just beginning to see the film grain. Today's press photographers, using digital equipment, can't capture even half this level of detail.","I've been reading Roseanna's Reply by Frank Johnson which is all about the time frame of the development of the P-51 Mustang. It's so nice to actually see what they look like! Wow!","Everyone is right. Not a P-51.","Looks like an early version actually designated the Apache A-36A as seen here in the US Air Force Museum in Dayton Ohio:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=493\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=493</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulgpics/6529258843/in/set-72157628169152555\">www.flickr.com/photos/paulgpics/6529258843/in/set-7215762...</a>\n\nNote the top air intake used with the Allison engine.

Interesting to see that nose turret arrangement.\r\nThe aircraft to the left is a Douglas B18 Bolo, a bomber based on the DC-2 transport aircraft. The B17 and B18 were designed to the same specification, so it's interesting to see the two in the same shot.","Was it really still being called the YB-17 in 1942?","It would be specific to the aircraft in this pic which is a Y1B-17, identifiable by the visible lack of armament, bubble blister in the nose glazing, no dorsal or ventral turrets. \r\nIt could be a 17or 17B , the only difference is turbochargers, so I suspect this is an non turbocharged aircraft","Twelve Y1B-17 were delivered between January and August 1937, equiping the USAAC's 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, Virginia. The 13th test bed model was redesignated Y1B-17A and provided with GR-1820-51 engines with General Electric turbocharger (supercharger powered by a turbine driven by exhaust gas). It flew for the first time on 29 April 1938 and subsequent testing gave proof of the superiority of the supercharged engine over normally aspirated ones and such engines were to become standard.\r\nThe YB-17's were designated B-17 by the 2nd Bombardment group at this point.\r\nThere was great political tension between the Army and the Navy at this point after the interception of the Italian liner &quot;Rex&quot;  which goes a long way to explaining why the USAAC had only 30 on the books when war broke out in Europe. \r\nThe order for Y1B-17 was followed by a contract for 39 B-17B's (same as the turbocharged Y1B-17A) which were all delivered by March 1940.\r\nThe B-17C, with uprated R-1820-65 engines and an increase from 5 to 7 guns were first ordered in 1939, and the first of 38 models flew in July 1940.","&quot;Hitler would like this man to go home&quot;\n&quot;A good American non-com&quot;\n&quot; man who knows his business and works hard at it&quot;\n\nWhat a crap.","wonderful lighting on this shot.","Agreed.

As Didge explained, the image is under exposed for the background, and then an off-camera flash (positioned at camera left presumably) most likely fitted with an umbrealla or other diffuser is used to illuminate the subject. The use of a diffuser and properly dialed-in flash is why the lighting is not harsh.","This is a great shot.
