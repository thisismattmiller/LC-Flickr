The war did not start until 1914, and the two countries were at peace up until then.","The next question is...  what was it?  The engine, unless I'm mistaken, Gnome Monosoupe 9.  No machine gun interrupt, you can see the the bolts holding on the deflector plates on the propeller.","The gnome engine of that period had an odd number of cylinders usually 5 7 or 9.  This engine has 8 cylinders which makes it a virtual certainty that could only be one engine from that period (and this plane is actually German?). What is that white banner across the top of the photo?","Actually, all rotary engines had odd numbers, and if you look at the positioning of the cylinders, you will see that there is a cylinder behind the propeller.  And by &quot;banner&quot;, do you mean the white steak where it looks like tape was once attached to the photo, preventing the emulsion in that area from greying, like it otherwise has?","Yes. I was wondering &quot;what's hidden behind the banner.  With regard to engines- four stroke radials are always odd in cylinder count. But two stroke engines have even cylinder counts and are lighter (ie good for early aircraft) and simpler than four stroke engines. However I will recount the cylinders.  I thought I was including the hidden ones, but perhaps not.","Rotary and single bank radial engines did not use counterbalancing cylinder action, and were all odd numbers, example, the 9 cylinder Wright R-1820, the engine used in the B-17 bomber and many other applications in WW2.  To understand how a rotary engine is put together and works, Vintage Aviator has many pictures of their new Oberursel engine construction, which was a copy of the Le Rhone engine of the same period (<a href=\"http://thevintageaviator.co.nz/files/images/ur2-assembly/screensize/ur2-assembly-046-crankcaseassy02.screensize.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">thevintageaviator.co.nz/files/images/ur2-assembly/screens...</a>).

The World co-operated to the fullest extent with the Chicago Herald and perhaps 150 other newspapers of the United States to this end—that the children of Europe, whose fathers have been killed in the war might be remembered by Santa Claus on Christmas. The Idea originated with James Keeley, publisher of the Chicago Herald. Generous response to the call on behalf of the children was made. The World established sixty-four receiving depots In New York. A general receiving station was established through the co-operation of Dock Commissioner R.A.C. Smith. This station was on the upper deck of Pier No. 1, North River. Its use was given to Commissioner Smith on behalf of the Christmas Ship by the lessees, the Iron Steamboat Company. The American Red Cross, under the guidance of` Miss Mabel T. Boardman, co-operated by offering to convey and deliver gifts to the children. This co-operation meant a wide and impartial distribution. Irving T. Bush, President of the Bush Terminal Company, offered the use, without cost, of the Bush Terminal stores. Gifts were handled there as well as at the Iron Steamboat Pier. The collier Jason was given by Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels to carry the Christmas presents to Europe. \n\nThe quantity of merchandise that was sent in response to The World's call for help for the orphan children was great. The pier was strung with electric lights and the work of preparing the cargo for shipment was rushed night and day. The soldiers from Fort Hamilton worked under Major Lawton of the Quartermaster's Department assorting the gifts. A company of marines helped the Red Cross representatives. The wives and daughters of the officers on Governor's Island and many others worked each day until the gifts were all stowed away in the big collier. When she steamed away, Lieutenant-Commander C. E. Courtney commanding, she bore 6,000,000 gifts. It was probably the most remarkable cargo that any ship ever carried from this or any other port.\n\nShe was given a great send-off.

The next day, he did not come to the store. He was thought ill, they would learn at his home. He had not returned since twenty-four hours. The jeweler continued his research and found  that he was missing pins, rings, necklaces, pendant,two pearls, a wrist bracelet, etc..,\nin all for 20,000 francs of jewelry.\nHe noticed Paul Gruault was not the only one guilty of embezzlement.\nA polisher, Widow Riviere, 48, 11 rue Louis-le-Grand, had contributed.\n\nHere's how the two employees infidels:\nwhen the jewelry out to clean the windows, they announced a couple of articles less. They brought out seventeen, for example, and they said there were only fifteen or sixteen.  Their boss believed that the items were also in the store and did not realize the theft.\n\nThe stolen jewels were then pawned or sold.\n\nAfter an investigation by highly skilled police, the two thieves were arrested and yesterday\nthey appeared before Mr. Judge Bouchardon.\nThey both said they had acted in moments of madness.\n\n Paul Gruault said, bursting into tears, I went to the richest young people\nme, I wanted to spend like them, I wanted to shine, I'm unhappy.\n\nPaul Gruault and the widow Riviere committed their flights independently\nfrom each other they were not associated, and their surprise was great to be together at\nthe judge.

Here is some of its history from Engineering News of 1912:\n&quot;Dry Dock No. 4, at the Brooklyn U. S. Navy Yard, has finally been completed after seven years' labor, during which three different contractors have successively taken over the contract. The dock is of concrete construction, 695 ft.long, 139 ft. wide and 31ft. deep, providing dockage for the largest naval vessels now contemplated. The contract for its construction was first let in 1905 to George Spearin, but the immense difficulties in foundation construction, resulting from the soft bottom encountered, caused that firm to abandon the job, and in 1907 it was relet to the Williams Engineering Co. Soon after, when only 15% of the work had been completed, that firm, too, was forced to abandon the contract. It was then thought that the Government would have to continue the work by day labor, but this was decided against and bids were asked for the completion of the work from private companies, plans for its prosecution to be submitted with the bid. Under this arrangement the contract was awarded in October, 1909, to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Rollins, of Boston, Mass. This firm carried the construction to a successful conclusion, and on May 10, 1912 it was emptied to allow the docking of the 22,000-ton  U. S. battleship &quot;Utah.&quot; The operation proved successful. The original appropriation for the construction was $1,500,000, of which $240,000 was expended in the first two attempts at construction. The final bid was $1,390,000, which was subsequently Increased to $2,750,000.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=YeMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=944&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA945#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Navy%20Yard%22%20Brooklyn&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=YeMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=944&amp;lr&...</a>\nI believe it is the only dry dock at the Brooklyn yard with a round end, and there appear to be many pictures of ships docked in it in the Bain collection.","@ Artolog, why bother changing the date, it's LOC's standard sometime between roughly 1910 and 1915 for the entire batch of negatives.","Well, I think they actually do change them once they receive enough information.

Before beginning her legal career, she taught grammar school and was one of the first female school principals in California, at Modoc County High School, in Alturas.\n\nIn 1912, she was admitted to the State Bar of California.[1] She campaigned for Woodrow Wilson in California, and was rewarded after his election with an appointment as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Northern District of California, 1914–1919. In 1918–1920 she was attorney in the same district. In 1920 she was appointed as the first female Assistant Attorney General of the United States, an office which she resigned in 1921.\n\nAdams ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1923. She had a successful private law practice until 1935, when she was appointed Assistant Special Counsel of U.S. Oil litigation. In 1942, California Governor Culbert Olson appointed her as Presiding Justice of the California Court of Appeal for the Third District in Sacramento. That court was, at the time, one of four intermediate appellate courts in California--intermediate, that is, between the trial courts located in every county, and the California Supreme Court. As the Presiding Justice for the Third District, Justice Adams was thus one of the four highest-ranking judges in the state after the Justices of the Supreme Court. She won election to a twelve-year term on the court of appeal later in 1942, but retired in 1952 for health reasons. In her time on the court, she wrote over 350 opinions. In 1950, she served by special assignment on one case in the California Supreme Court, becoming the first woman to sit on that court (Gardner v. Jonathon Club (1950) 35 Cal.2d 343) [2]\n\nAdams died at her home in Sacramento in 1956.","Interesting :)","Her official biography from the California courts website is as follows, and is a little different as to some details than the wikipedia account above:\n&quot;Annette Abbott Adams (March 12, 1877 - October 26, 1956) Presiding Justice, May 1942 - November 1952\nAn extraordinary woman and true trailblazer, Annette Abbott Adams was one of the first women school principals in California, one of the first two women to receive a law degree from the University of California, one of the first women to be admitted to the California Bar, the first woman to serve as a U.S. Attorney, the first woman appointed Assistant U.S. Attorney General, and the first woman to serve as an appellate court justice in California. She was born March 12, 1877, in Prattville, Plumas County, and attended Chico State Normal School, University of California, Berkeley (BL, 1904), and Boalt Hall (JD, 1912). Adams taught grammar school and was principal of Modoc County High School, Alturas, prior to her career in law. Admitted to the California Bar in 1912, she practiced law in Quincy, and then in San Francisco, before becoming Assistant U.S. Attorney, 1914-18, and U.S. Attorney, 1918-20. After serving as Assistant U.S. Attorney General, 1920-21, she returned to San Francisco and practiced law there until 1935, when she was appointed Assistant Special Counsel of U.S. oil litigation. In March 1942, she became California's first female appellate justice when Governor Olson appointed her Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District. Justice Adams retired December 1952; she died at her Sacramento home four years later, October 26, 1956.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/2673.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.courts.ca.gov/2673.htm</a>","artolog: \n\nThanks for the information from the California courts website, which seems like a reliable source for the details on Adams.

According to this NYT piece he was a journalist before he ascended the throne and used to travel incognito.  So maybe he was in the US earlier, although the piece implies not.

It does seem that Bain had a habit of finding earlier photographs - often of European royals - for use in the paper when something significant happened, like a crowning or other event.  \n\nThe sticker on the upper left corner of this image has a very faint 1914 date and perhaps October or November as the month. King Albert of Belgium was in the news quite a bit in the last part of 1914 as he was personally leading the Belgian army in their battle against the invading German forces.  Numerous articles in U.S. newspapers speak about the battles fought, his injuries and his heroics, so it is not surprising this image might have appeared in the papers. (For example, a Nov. 12, 1914 article in the Chicago Tribune is titled King Albert of Belgium a Hero of All Europe.)\n\nI checked the original photograph of Anna Held you cited with the name of the photographer and completely agree that this is the same signature, and is for Aime Dupont.  King Albert would have been a 22 year old prince in 1898, which does seem right for the photo here, and that Dupont was a Belgian photographer is a good point. \n\nWith all of this in mind, we will add more information to the record.

McGraw and Mack had known each other for years, and McGraw accepted it graciously. By 1909, the A's were wearing an elephant logo on their sweaters, and in 1918 it turned up on the regular uniform jersey for the first time. Over the years the elephant has appeared in several different colors. It is currently forest green. The A’s are still sometimes, though infrequently, referred to as the &quot;Elephants&quot; or &quot;White Elephants.&quot;\n\nThe elephant was retired as team mascot in 1963 by then-owner Charles O. Finley in favor of a Missouri mule (it was also rumored to have been done by Finley in order to attract fans from the then heavily Democratic constituents of Missouri by replacing the traditional Republican mascot to one associated with Democrats). In 1988, the elephant was restored as the symbol of the Athletics and currently adorns the left sleeve of home and road uniforms. The Elephant Mascot returned briefly in the mid-'80s, under the name Harry Elephante. In 1997, the elephant returned, taking its current form: Stomper.","Another Bain photo of Garry Herrmann:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4627029952/]","John &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald (b. 1863 - d. 1950), Boston mayor, father of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and grandfather of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.","He shakes hands like a pansy.","He's about to go planking!","old photo but very nice","love it！","Nice!","The gentleman behind and to Edison's right appears to be Josephus Daniels, then Secretary of the Navy.

During the Crimean War the Algerian tirailleurs acquired the nickname of &quot;Turcos&quot; (Turks) by which they were widely known over the next hundred years.

Gilbert Exposes Impostor - Airmen Escape After Breakdown</b>\nNew York Times\nSeptember 3, 1914\nPARIS, Sept. 2. - Mme. Gilbert, wife of the famous aviator, was recently arrested near Clermont-Ferrand at the Village of Parlay-le-Monial, where she was informed her husband was being feted on his return from a successful raid.  On her arrival she found her alleged husband an imposter - a warrant has been issued for his arrest, since the real Gilbert is at Dole - and she was challenged by a gendarme when trying to return home.  Finding her without papers and carrying German uniform buttons, which she bought from prisoners as souvenirs, he promptly arrested her.  Release was obtained with difficulty on the arrival of her father-in-law with the necessary information.\n\n- Then there was his internment in Switzerland...\n\nGilbert engaged in a bombing mission on June 27, 1915, when he dropped five bombs from his aircraft upon the Zeppelin works at Freidrichshafen, Germany on Lake Constance.  It was during this raid, however, that his aircraft was struck by anti-aircraft fire.  Gilbert was then forced to land his crippled aircraft near Rhinefelden, in neutral Switzerland, where he was interned as a belligerent (See: <u>Flying, Volume 4</u>, August 1915, Page 634,   <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=st1LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA634&amp;dq=eugene+gilbert,+aviator&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UjmGTpDkDqTv0gHv77HLDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=st1LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA634&amp;d...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C11F83C5D17738DDDA00A94D0405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C11F83C5D17738...</a>\n<b>RETURN PRISONER TO SWISS; French Order Their Aviator Who Escaped to Give Himself Up.</b>\nNew York Times\nAugust 29, 1915\nPARIS, Aug. 28. -- Eugene Gilbert, the French aviator who recently escaped from Switzerland after being interned there, returned to Switzerland and gave himself up to night by order of the French Government.\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20811F63E5D16738DDDA80B94D0405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20811F63E5D16738...</a>\n<b>SWISS THANK FRANCE FOR GILBERT'S RETURN; Say Aviator Who Escaped Had Not Been Released from Terms of Promise.</b>\nNew York Times\nAugust 31, 1915\nPARIS, Aug. 30. -- Eugene Gilbert, the French aviator whose return to Switzerland after his escape from internment in that country was ordered by the French Government, arrived in Berne yesterday escorted by Captain Dufour of the Swiss Army, according to a Havas News Agency dispatch from Berne. \n\n- Although Gilbert was returned to Switzerland for internment, he would once more escape Switzerland and rejoin the French air service later in the war.

Engineering officer with extensive colonial experience; a protégé of Galliéni.  Appointed chief of the General Staff over better-known colleagues, 1911; strongly encouraged the offensive doctrine that was in vogue at the time.  In Aug.1914, his initial refusal to admit the failure of his opening offensives and to grasp the strength of the German invasion nearly cost France the war at the very outset, but in the crisis of the Long Retreat Joffre’s strengths emerged: he remained imperturbable, kept a tight grip on his armies, and struck back hard when an opportunity appeared.  His victory at the Marne was incomplete - the Germans were stopped, but not broken - but it was enough to give the authoritarian Joffre the prestige to assume almost dictatorial powers for a time.  His 1915 offensives were bloody failures, the German attack on Verdun in 1916 revealed serious deficiencies, and in Dec.1916, he was effectively removed from power by being kicked upstairs to ceremonial and figurehead roles.  Joffre was purposeful, very strong-willed, and profoundly self-confident - but he was also stubborn, autocratic, and imperceptive.  In the first weeks of the war, it can be said that he saved France, after putting France in the position of needing to be saved. &quot;","From <a href=\"http://cnparm.home.texas.net/Wars/Marne/MarneBios.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">cnparm.home.texas.net/Wars/Marne/MarneBios.htm</a>\n&quot;Joseph Galliéni (1849-1916) - Military Governor of Paris, 1914-1915.

Energetically organized Paris’s defenses in the crisis of Aug-Sep 1914 and played a key role in French planning for the First Battle of the Marne.  As War Minister, Oct.1915-Mar.1916, he clashed with Joffre but was forced to resign due to illness, dying soon afterwards.

Allied forces advanced over seven miles on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with Henry Rawlinson's British Fourth Army playing the decisive role.

This is largely due to George Grantham Bain, and the Bain offices themselves, being based in New York City.  Also, in 1914, both the New York Yankees and New York Giants played at the Polo Grounds.

At Jutland, 4 of the strongest battleships in the world were left 5 miles behind the battle against the German battle cruisers because of the way the flags were handled. In the directly ensuing battle, 2 British battle cruisers were sunk.

She was too slow to out run them, and too lightly armed/gunned to fight them. The decision to include her in the line meant the end of her at the battle of Dogger Bank.  A misunderstood British signal led to her destruction by overwhelming forces while allowing the rest of the German battle cruiser squadron to escape.

The site was also used as an internment camp for &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, mainly eastern Europeans. The name Valcartier comes from the town of Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, of which a large section was expropriated in order to create the military training camp.

His home run crown would be the first of four consecutive seasons leading the American League in home runs. He hit 11 home runs in 1911, 10 home runs in 1912, 12 home runs in 1913, and nine home runs in 1914. In two of those seasons he also led the American League in runs batted in.\nIn seven seasons with the A's he hit .321 with 48 home runs, 612 RBIs and 88 triples in 866 games played.\nBaker played third base for the Athletics until 1915, when he sat out the entire season in a contract dispute with Connie Mack. He remained in baseball, playing for Upland, Pennsylvania in the semiprofessional Delaware County League.[1]\n[edit]New York Yankees\nMack sold Baker's contract in 1916 to the New York Yankees, with whom he finished his career. He led the league in games played with 141 games in 1919\nInitially, Baker retired in 1920, but came back to play two more seasons with the Yankees, seasons that took him to two more World Series. He finished his tenure with the Yankees with a .288 batting average, 46 home runs and 375 RBIs in 676 games.\n[edit]Managerial career\nFollowing his retirement, Baker managed for two seasons (1924-1925) in the Eastern Shore Baseball League, and was credited with discovering Jimmie Foxx and recommending him to Athletics manager Connie Mack.\n[edit]Legacy\nIn addition to his 1955 election to the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1981 Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.\nHome Run Baker was laid to rest in Easton, Maryland.\nThere is a statue of Home Run Baker in the southwest area of UMass-Amherst.

The Kaiser is German Emperor and King of Prussia. These titles were scrupulously observed in Germany and elsewhere, e.g., by Queen Victoria when the pair stayed at Windsor. The title underlines a major political point. The Kaiser was first among equals, there being four royal houses in the German empire - Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Wurttemmberg. Hence - German Emperor and not Emperor of Germany. If this is hard to grasp then imagine a King of England, a King of Scotland, a King of Wales, and a King of Ireland. The King of England is the British Emperor, being first amongst equals. Bismarck instituted this arrangement, much to the annoyance of Kaiser Wilhelm's grandfather who wanted to be called Emperor of Germany.","J Davidson of the Swedish-American Athletic Club won the discus-throwing \n  <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=-GQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=j+davidson+discus\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=-GQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;l...</a>\nat District Championships in June 1914.","Another Bain Agency photo of the launch of the Lundin Power Lifeboat:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5765102874/]","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Petrus_Lundin\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Petrus_Lundin</a>","<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?ss=2&amp;w=8623220@N02&amp;q=evelyn+nesbit&amp;m=text\">Repeat appearance</a>:\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Nesbit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evelyn Nesbit</a> (December 25, 1884 – January 17, 1967) was an American artists' model and chorus girl, noted for her entanglement in the murder of her ex-lover, architect Stanford White, by her first husband, Harry Kendall Thaw.\n\nThis was likely taken at her husband's trial.\n\nEvelyn &amp; son:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/trialsanderrors/4574521114/]","I think that the photo was taken aboard a ship, probably (since it is a Bain Agency photo) a ship in New York harbor.

He was a right-handed pitcher who spent 10 seasons in the majors, mostly with the Detroit Tigers. Purchased by the Tigers from the Wichita Jobbers of the Western Association in August of 1906, he made his major league debut in September of that season in a 2-0 complete game loss to the White Sox at Bennett Park in Detroit. He appeared in just 13 games his first two seasons, pitching to a 1-8 record during that time. 1908 would be his breakout season, as he pitched to a 15-8 record and 2.28 ERA. He did all of this despite an ankle injury that threatened to curtail his season. Exceptionally strong and powerfully built, Detroit manager Hughie Jennings once remarked, &quot;Ed is always out there keeping the boys steady. He takes the ball whenever he's told and never seems to tire.&quot; His best season was 1909 when he had a 21-10 record with a 2.34 ERA. A fellow southerner like his teammate Ty Cobb, Willett nonetheless chose to socialize with teammates such as George Mullin, Ed Killian and Matty McIntyre, who were part of an anti-Cobb faction on the club. Pitching out of the bullpen, he appeared in 2 games during the 1909 World Series, allowing 3 hits and 1 unearned run in 7.2 innings of work. After 8 seasons and 96 wins in a Detroit uniform, he jumped his contract and signed with the newly formed Federal League's St. Louis Terriers. Unlike many players who's stats improved by moving to the new league, Willett digressed. He would go a combined 6-19 during his two year stay in St. Louis. Given his release in September of 1915, he would go on to pitch in the minors for 4 more seasons, making stops with Memphis and New Orleans of the Southern Association and Salt Lake City of the PCL. After his retirement, he worked as a carpenter and continued to coach amateur baseball teams. He died from a raptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 50. Over the course of his career, he accrued a 102-99 record with a 3.04 ERA and 5 saves in 274 games.

Michel (LOC)\" /></a>\n\nSome background:\n&quot;Unlike the Germans, the French could not agree on the best plans for war. In the years before the war, prominent generals had argued over how to prepare for a war with Germany. One-time commander in chief General Victor Michel guessed that the German attack would come through Belgium and proposed that the first French action should be to cut off the Germans in Belgium before they could reach French territory. Michel's plan, which was unpopular with political leaders but turned out to be absolutely correct, cost him his job. His replacement, General Joseph Joffre (1852–1931), called instead for a direct attack on German positions in the formerly French territories of Alsace-Lorraine. (He called for a smaller force to monitor German activities in Belgium.) Joffre's plan was adopted by his country, and it left France highly vulnerable to the German Schlieffen plan. Joffre also underestimated the number of German troops the French armies would face and overestimated the impact that Russian battles would have on the conflict. Joffre's faulty vision of how the war would unfold cost the French dearly in the early stages of the conflict.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://find.galegroup.com/gic/infomark.do?contentSet=EBKS&amp;docType=EBKS.Article&amp;idigest=fb720fd31d9036c1ed2d1f3a0500fcc2&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T001&amp;prodId=GIC&amp;docId=CX3411700012&amp;userGroupName=itsbtrial&amp;version=1.0&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;source=gale\" rel=\"nofollow\">find.galegroup.com/gic/infomark.do?contentSet=EBKS&amp;do...</a>","poor Alsace, torn between France and Germany between 1870 and WWII.

Commissioned in the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, he served in the Second Boer War and joined the Canadian Militia on return to Canada.\nOn the eve of the First World War he offered the Canadian government $100 000 to help raise and equip an infantry battalion for overseas duty, leading to the formation in 1914 of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Gault accompanied the regiment overseas as second-in-command, fighting until the loss of his left leg.

The population of the vicinity grew steadily, with about 5,000 people drawing water from Lac Hertel in 1941 when an aqueduct from the lake was constructed.\n\nGault enjoyed many wonderful days on his mountain property as development continued in the region through the early part of the 20th century. He loved the wild nature of the mountain and became committed to preserving its special character. Others were not so respectful. Prospectors searched for uranium and diamonds, posing a threat of expropriation, and others exploited mineral deposits on the flanks of the mountain. Gault remained vigilant and firm in his commitments to protect the mountain during this period, agreeing only to provide water from Lac Hertel to the city of Beloeil beginning in 1940.\n\nIn 1957, Gault began construction of a manor house on the shore of Lac Hertel to which he planned to retire, but he died before its completion. He had left his property to McGill University in the hope that this well-established institution of higher learning could continue his efforts to protect the mountain for future generations. &quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mcgill.ca/gault/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mcgill.ca/gault/</a>   describes how the estate is used now as a resource for research and public access.","trialsanderrors and swanq:  Thanks for the additional information on Gault.

I never had the guts enough to try, because I didn’t think I could make it. I’d run down the line, and he’d keep insisting that I take a bigger lead.

She was Germany's first battle cruiser, and first turbine powered capital ship, Unlike Britain's battle cruisers, Germany's were required to be able to fight in the &quot;line&quot; with battleships.  her hull and machinery comprised 47.4% of her weight, vs 57.3% for  HMS Indefatigable, 30% for armor vs 20, and each used about 13.75 for armament.  Consequently, the German battle cruisers took enormous amount of punishment in the WWI battles without sinking.  On her trials she achieved a speed of 28.124 knots, making her the fastest dreadnought in the world.  In the battle of Jutland, she fired 52 large shells at Indefatigable, scoring 5 hits that caused her to explode and sink.  She suffered multiple large hits causing all 4 turrets to be out of action at one point, but remained in the battle line.   She was ultimately scuttled at Scapa Flow by her crew. Her name should be corrected to &quot;von der Tann&quot;  (info from Gary Staff, German Battle Cruisers 1914-1918, Osprey Publishing)","Ein wunderschönes Schiff!","SMS Von der Tann[a] was the first battlecruiser built for the German Kaiserliche Marine, as well as Germany's first major turbine-powered warship. At the time of her construction, Von der Tann was the fastest dreadnought-type warship afloat, capable of reaching speeds of more than 27 knots. Built by Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg, Von der Tann was the workhorse of the High Seas Fleet Scouting Squadron.\n\nVon der Tann was designed in response to the British Invincible class. While the German design had slightly lighter guns—28 cm (11 in),[b] compared to the 30.5 cm (12 in) Mark X mounted on the British ships—Von der Tann was faster and significantly better-armored. She set the precedent of German battlecruisers carrying much heavier armor than their British equivalents, albeit at the cost of smaller guns.\n\nThe ship participated in a number of fleet actions during the First World War, including the Battle of Jutland, where she destroyed the British battlecruiser HMS Indefatigable within minutes of the engagement. Von der Tann was hit several times by large-caliber shells, but the damage was quickly repaired and the ship returned to the fleet in two months.\n\nFollowing the end of the war in 1918, Von der Tann, along with most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when the fleet was scuttled in 1919 to prevent them falling into British hands. The wreck of Von der Tann was raised in 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth from 1931 to 1934\nVon der Tann carried eight 28 cm (11 in) SK L/45[d] guns, mounted in four twin turrets: one fore, one aft, and two staggered wing turrets. The guns were emplaced in the Drh.L C/1907 turntable mount, which was traversed electrically, while the guns themselves used hydraulics to change elevation.[8] The guns could be elevated up to 20 degrees, which enabled a maximum range of 18,900 m (20,700 yd). A refit in 1915 increased this to 20,400 m (22,300 yd). The main guns fired a 302 kg (670 lb) armored-piercing shell that had a muzzle velocity of 875 m/s; the main propellant charges were encased in a brass cartridge. A total of 660 projectiles were stored in four shell rooms, each containing 165 shells. The wing turrets were staggered in such a way that all eight guns were able to fire on broadside on a very wide arc.\nUnlike her British contemporaries, Von der Tann also carried a heavy secondary battery, consisting of ten 15 cm (5.9 in) SK L/45 guns, casemated in MPL C/06 pivot mounts, each with 150 high explosive and armor-piercing shells. At construction, these guns could fire their 45.3 kg (100 lb) shells at targets up to 13,500 m (14,800 yd) away; after the 1915 refit, their maximum range was extended to 16,800 m (18,400 yd).She was also armed with sixteen 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/45 guns, to defend against torpedo boats and destroyers. These were also emplaced in pivot mounts, of the MPL C/01-06 type, with a total of 3,200 shells for these guns. These guns fired a 9 kg (20 lb) shell at the high rate of 15 rounds per minute, up to a range of 10,694 m (11,695 yd), which was quite long for a smaller caliber weapon. In late 1916, following repair work after the damage sustained during the Battle of Jutland, Von der Tann had her 8.8 cm (3.5 in) guns removed and the firing ports welded shut. Two 8.8 cm flak guns were installed on the aft superstructure.\n\nAs was customary for capital ships of the time, Von der Tann was equipped with four 45 cm (18 in) torpedo tubes, with a total of 11 torpedoes. These were located in the bow, the stern, and two on the broadside. The torpedoes carried a 110 kg (240 lb) warhead, and had an effective range of 2 km (1.04 nmi) when set for a speed of 32 kn (59 km/h), and 1.5 km (0.81 nmi) at 36 kn (67 km/","Kilted Cowboy and tormentor4555:\n\nThank you for the extensive information about this vessel.

This perhaps rather under-plays the importance of public opinion around the world – to replace the commander-in-chief of the Grand Fleet two months into a world war, before any clash at sea, and during the period of the Race to the Sea, would not have been seen as a confident move. &quot;","Rabbit Maranville looks pretty pissed off.","The good old days, before drugs; where hard work, talent, and determination made a stellar ball player.","<b>Please consider adding your Snap With Attitude to our group:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/ram_iyer/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5092/5417768219_cc7901fa3b_t.jpg\" title=\"Snaps with Attitude!\" /> \nSnaps with Attitude!

She fired only 48 12 inch (305 mm) shells but is credited with scoring several hits on the German battlecruiser Lützow.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Neptune_(1909)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Neptune_(1909)</a>","If anything, HMS Neptune was a retrograde step for the Royal Navy, the big gun arrangement was unusual and in practice was found to limit the guns effectiveness to a major degree.....in theory, she had a broadside of all ten 12&quot; guns, but the two staggered centrally mounted turrets only had very small arcs of fire so the actual maximum number of guns that could be fired simultaneously as a broadside,  was therefore only eight, the three turrets mounted on the centre line plus the &quot;wing' turret actually on the side towards which the ship was firing, the turret on the opposite side of the ship was effectively silenced! Had all ten been fired, as was supposed to be possible, there was also the detrimental effects of the blast on the ships superstructure to take into account.......the likelihood and effects of blast damage to superstructure also effectively prevented the wing turrets from firing directly ahead or astern too, again reducing potential fire power in either direction.\n  It seems strange to note that, despite the handicaps imposed by these turret arrangements, which must have been glaringly obvious to many senior naval officers and ship designers of the day, the layout was repeated in the next class of battleship, the Colossus class, ordered and laid down the same year!","Very interesting. I was just reading a WWI book that briefly discussed the Battle of Jutland, and it mentioned the Neptune didn't fire many shots, but it did not say why.","the unusual arrangement of the midships big gun turrets allowed for two &quot;flying bridges&quot; to be constructed above them. This cumbersome arrangement was also a feature of the later, similar Colossus class, but it was discontinued after these ships because there was a very real fear that if the structures took damage from incoming fire, they could collapse and obstruct or damage or jam the gun turrets underneath them. The whole layout of wing turrets and flying bridges was ill-conceived and badly thought out, and was never repeated(thankfully). the Colossus class also incorporated another retrograde step in capital ship design, by having the mainmast stepped abaft the fore funnel. With a head wind, or at high speed, this meant the spotting top on the mainmast was rendered completely unusable and uninhabitable, due to the heat and smoke and exhaust gases from the forward funnel which enveloped it.","it was a difficult time being a ship designer, new classes came out almost yearly between 1909 and the end of the war.  Superfiring/centerline guns were just being designed even as the guns themselves were being made larger and heavier.  Oftentimes the original design was modified even after the keel was laid, and England and Germany each modified designs on the ways as each side unveiled their latest creation, and both treasuries were continually stretched to the limit., ultimately leading to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.","Around the time the Neptune and Colossus classes were being built,  the RN and the Admiralty, while maintaining the apparent lead over its potential rivals,  saw much of British naval design became obsessed and obscured by arithmetic. For example, as we have seen, the Neptune and Colossus classes did not have a broadside of all ten 12&quot; guns, the gun layout precluded this and eight was the maximum actually possible. Their maximum armour belt thickness was actually less than that of HMS Dreadnought herself, built five years earlier!  Needless to say, this fact was NOT made public knowledge!  At the same time, the scanty armour protection of the latest battlecruisers was deliberately and greatly exaggerated, so that on paper, at least, the RN was a  vastly superior force in all respects to any and all of its potential enemies.  The only thing that mattered, it seems, with the benefit of hindsight, was numbers,  bigger ships with bigger guns. British capital ships of this period were not faulty, or ineffective, but their true fighting value was somewhat disguised by arithmetical inaccuracy, and this was only exposed to public scrutiny under the rigours of war, and as we all know, the catalogue of battleship and battlecruiser losses between 1914-18 brought this into very sharp focus.........","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_Perdue\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herbert Rodney Perdue</a> (June 7, 1882 in Bethpage, Tennessee - October 31, 1968 in Gallatin, Tennessee), was a professional baseball player who played pitcher in the Major Leagues from 1911-1915.

They were originally known as armoured cruisers until they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911.

By 1914 things were in pretty good shape but then war broke out and everyone went off the gold standard. The gold standard wasn't restored until 1925 and didn't last much longer after that.

As a result, the Cape Cod Canal was purchased by the U.S. Government in 1928. The canal was widened and deepened to nearly 500 feet wide and 32 feet deep.\n\nA new 544-foot wide vertical lift bridge, known as the <i>Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge</i> (also known as the <i>Buzzard's Bay Railroad Bridge</i>), was completed in 1935, and is in use to this day.[<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod_Canal_Railroad_Bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] &nbsp; The new bridge weighs in at almost twice the weight of the old: 2,050 tons. \n\nA 1987 photo by photographer Martin Stupich of the &quot;new&quot; vertical lift bridge, from the collection of The Library of Congress, is shown below:\n&nbsp;\n&quot;General View of Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge&quot; by<i> The Library of Congress</i>\n<a href=\"http://loc.gov/pictures/item/ma1332\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img height=\"150\" width=\"250\" src=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ma/ma1300/ma1332/photos/073840pr.jpg\" />\n&nbsp;</a>","&quot;Unfortunately the original...canal was hopelessly too narrow and too shallow....&quot;\n\nThis seems to be the case with every canal ever built.","&quot;There is no apostrophe in the town name, Buzzards Bay.&quot;\nSimilar confusion with a town in Ontario, which has 3 variants:\n &quot;Smith's Falls&quot; or &quot;Smith Falls&quot; or  &quot;Smiths Falls&quot;\n\nIt's almost impossible to say &quot;Smiths Falls.&quot; It comes out as &quot;Smiss Falls&quot;\nNice bascule bridge there, btw.

Nació en Ixtacomitán, Chiapas el 3 de diciembre de 1873. Licenciado por la Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia. Fue secretario del Comité Anti-Reeleccionista de Estudiantes que encabezó el movimiento de 1892 en contra de un nuevo período de Porfirio Díaz como Presidente de México. Herido por la policía, estuvo preso y recluido en la cárcel de Belén. Después de su liberación trabajó en 1893 en la redacción del diario &quot;El Demócrata&quot;, junto con los hermanos Flores Magón. Fue abogado en Ensenada, juez de primera instancia en Córdoba, diputado federal suplente y miembro de la Comisión organizadora del Partido Democrático. Como diputado propietario a la XXVI Legislatura, junto Nemesio García Naranjo, Francisco Olaguíbel y José María Lozano formó parte del llamado &quot;cuadrilátero&quot;, que se distinguió por la virulencia de sus ataques al gobierno maderista. Asimismo, junto con César Castellanos (padre de la escritora Rosario Castellanos), Rómulo Farrera, Adolfo E. Grajales, Jesús Martínez Rojas (fundador de la camarilla “La Mano Negra” san-cristobalense) y Manuel Rovelo Argüello, fue miembro de la diputación chiapaneca en la XXVI Legislatura Federal autora de la iniciativa de ley para que el petróleo y sus derivados fueran nacionalizados.1\n \nEn 1911, en sustitución de Manuel Rovelo Argüello, fue designado gobernador interino de su estado natal pero no llegó a ocupar el puesto. Fungió como subsecretario y, luego, como titular de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores en el gobierno golpista de Victoriano Huerta. Luego estuvo al frente de la Secretaría de Fomento. A la caída de la dictadura huyó a los Estados Unidos de América y, después, a Cuba. Volvió a México y trabajó como abogado defensor en los tribunales populares de la cárcel de Belén.

However, in E.L. Doctorow's original novel &quot;Ragtime&quot; (published in 1975), Waldo's role is minor while Charles S.

This is <u>not</u> one of the 1914 flights, as is apparent by comparing October 7,1903 photos of the attempted flight with this one.  As per Wikipedia:\n<i>With Smithsonian approval, Glenn Curtiss extensively modified the Aerodrome and made a few short flights in it in 1914, as part of an unsuccessful attempt to bypass the Wright Brothers' patent on aircraft and to vindicate [Samuel] Langley. Based on these flights, the Smithsonian displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier-than-air manned, powered aircraft &quot;capable of flight.&quot; This action triggered a feud with Orville Wright (Wilbur Wright died in 1912), who accused the Smithsonian of misrepresenting flying machine history. Orville backed up his protest by refusing to donate the original 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer to the Smithsonian, instead exiling it to Science Museum of London in 1928. The dispute finally ended in 1942 when the Smithsonian published details of the Curtiss modifications to the Aerodrome and recanted its claims for the aircraft.</i>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley_Aerodrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley_Aerodrome</a>","TVL 1970:  Thank you for identifying this aircraft as the Langley Aerodrome, developed by Smithsonian Institution secretary Samuel P.

They were to fly the Rodman Wanamaker airship, America, from Newfoundland to Ireland in the summer of 1914.  The original plan had been to fly in June, but  problems with the plane's design led to postponement well into July.  Porte insisted on flying at night during the full moon so that he could navigate by the stars.  By the time the America was ready to fly, the next avialable date that met Porte's criteria was in August 1914.

Cranston Brenton of Yonkers, N.Y., head of the Social Service Commission of the Protestant Episcopal Church in New York State, scored strongly this afternoon when her counsel obtained startling admissions from the star witness of the defense.","Mrs. Elizabeth Alden Curtis (Brenton) Holman was institutionalized at Brattleboro (VT) Insane Asylum in 1912, apparently in connection with their divorce.  Her first husband (a professor at Trinity College) found two doctors to attest that she was insane.  She sued them all for damages, accusing Brenton of using hypnotism to convince her to sign away her liberty.  In June 1914, she won a verdict against Rev. Brenton and one of the doctors (Paul Waterman), and was awarded $4000.\n\nBut Elizabeth Alden Curtis (Brenton) Holman (b 1879--corrected 3/20) wasn't just an aggrieved spouse; she was a writer.  In 1902 she published a version of <i>The Lament of Baba Tahir</i>, a Persian text, under the name Elizabeth Curtis Brenton; in 1912, she and Holman (not yet married) filed for copyright for a play she wrote, based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  Also in 1912, she published a play called <i>The Norseman</i>.  She also published poetry in the Connecticut Magazine, The Crisis, and other literary periodicals.  In 1900, she's mentioned in a <i>Nation</i> article as an American poet working on a &quot;thoughtful, pure, and even pleasing&quot; version of the Rubaiyat.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=yAYDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=yAYDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;l...</a>\n\nAs &quot;Elizabeth Curtis Brenton,&quot; she had letters that appeared in the New York Times Saturday Review of Books in 1901 and 1905.\n\nShe may have married again after Holman; I find two listings for an &quot;Elizabeth Alden Curtis Tidd&quot; of Connecticut, filing for copyright on plays she wrote in 1929 and 1933.

The EX3 was also known as the &quot;L56,&quot; which related to the displacement of the EX3's 4-cylinder engine.","Another of the 3 (so far) Bain Collection picutes of George Boillot:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6174912033/\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6174912033_09c48a6c45_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Boillot and Rigal (LOC)\" /></a>","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatley_Hills_Golf_Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatley_Hills_Golf_Club</a>","Other Bain/LOC photos from Wheatley Hills:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5517544362/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5516954477/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5516954731/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5516954587/]","LOC: Your caption is misspelled.

Keep in mind that the original negative is different from what you see here -- the white or clear areas of the original negative display here as black, and the darker areas of the negative display here as lighter areas. The digital image reverses the polarity of the negative, like making a print from a negative.\n\n(1)  The Bain News Service staff scratched letters into the emulsion on a glass plate using a sharp-pointed tool. They wrote the letters backwards, so that the words read correctly left-to-right when the negative is printed. The Bain staff made a lot of prints from the same negative and many prints every day. The etching technique made it easy to label each print and to tell one print from another -- the basic identification information was right there on the front of each print. &quot;Etching&quot; letters backwards can also be hard to do, so the etched text tends to be brief. \nExample:  &quot;SMITH, BKLYN&quot; consists of black letters here, but the letters are clear on the original negative--lines where the emulsion has been scratched off.\n\n(2) The Bain News Service staff also wrote with black ink on the glass side of a negative--the light letters in this image. That way their notes could be made more quickly (without writing backwards). In the scan, these words and dates appear in &quot;mirror image&quot;  because they are on the glass side rather than the emulsion side of the plate. The benefit of writing dates and ids on the glass?  It's a quick way to note the basic ID info for negatives as they arrived at the news photo service--the paper sleeves and index cards came later. Also, when pulling a negative from the files to print, you had a quick confirmation right on the plate that you had the correct negative. \nExamples:  &quot;SS 4/20/14&quot; on the side of the negative  and  &quot;Smith  3rd baseman Brooklyn&quot; at the top of the negative","are these images reversed, then? \n\n\n\n indelible black  ink on the glass side  , !, thank you","Very good\nThanks for sharing","I wish I had a name as cool as Zach Wheat.","Assuming the date (7 May 1914) is correct, this photograph was taken at the Baker Bowl in Philadelphia, where the Robins (as the Brooklyn team was called then) beat the Phillies, 6-5.

It is for one hour.\n\n&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Empress_of_Ireland\nand\n<a href=\"http://www.sea-viewdiving.com/shipwreck_info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sea-viewdiving.com/shipwreck_info/</a>\nempress_home/thetragedy.htm\n\n&quot;This is another story involving Marconi Wireless Telegraph company personnel. What the two links above do not say is that Ron Ferguson, G4VF, was the Senior Wireless Officer aboard the Empress of Ireland and had just retired for the night when the collision occurred. Ron became President of the Chelmsford Amateur Radio Society (CARS) and lived in Chelmsford, Essex.\n\n&quot;His Second in Command was on duty. On feeling the collision, Ron dressed and took over the Wireless Room and told him to get into a lifeboat, which he did.\n\n&quot;Ron hammered out a SOS which was picked up by the Marconi shore station at Father Point. They informed the marine people who launch 5 boats. These were tugs and what were available at short notice.\n\n&quot;Officially Ron should have waited to receive instructions from the Captain but took it unto himself to send the SOS as he rated (quite correctly as it turned out) to be a desperate situation.\n\n&quot;Ron stayed at his post giving directions, points to aid the rescuers until after only 12 minutes or so the Wireless failed and a huge wave swept him out of his Wireless Room. He grabbed a large deck-chair that swept past him and was then washed overboard.\n\n&quot;He was rescued by the Collier. Either the Collier had a Wireless but no Wireless Officer or Ron was transferred to one of the rescue ships.\n\n&quot;One way or another Ron found himself on a ship with a Marconi Wireless but no Wireless Officer. He was given permission by the Captain to break the lock and for many hours continued to coordinate the rescue.\n\n&quot;2 years later Ron visited the Shore Station at Father Point and someone said “Hello Ron, that is your jacket”. It had been hanging on a peg all that time.\n\n&quot;In the early 1970s I said to Ron one evening at a CARS Meeting “Ron, weren’t you involved with the Empress of Ireland?” not really knowing anything of the story.\n\n“'Well that was a long time ago, lad – let’s get on with tonight’s meeting'\n\n&quot;That was as much as I ever got from Ron.\n\n&quot;I do not think Ron was ever awarded any medal or citation for his involvement with saving the lives of over 400 persons.\n\n&quot;Do you know more or different to my story above?\n\n&quot;This is another story we will commemorate in 4 year's time when it is the Centenary. Every year the Canadians have a commemoration day to remember the 1,012 or so who died in that dreadful accident.\n\n&quot;See what the TV show tells us about the event. \n\n&quot;Regards \nJohn G8DET&quot;","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe-au-P%C3%A8re,_Quebec\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe-au-P%C3%A8re,_Quebec</a>","Thank you Wystan and Richard Arthur Norton for the context to this image of the wireless station at Father Point, Quebec.

Crellin, of Silverstone, \nBritish Columbia, was graphic. \n\nCrellin is a prosperous farmer. He was one of the heroes of \nthe wreck. He saved Florence Barbour, the eight-year-old \ndaughter of a neighbor, by swimming with the child on his \nback, and, with the aid of another rugged passenger, pulled two \nwomen and several men into a collapsible boat. \n\nClad only in a night shirt, Crellin said the water and air \nwere as cold as winter, chilling all hands to the bone. \n\nDespite the peril and exposure, flaxen-haired Florence Bar- \nbour clung to Crellin's neck and never even cried. \n\n&quot;The child was pluckier than a stout man/' said Crellin. \n&quot;She never even whimpered, and complaint was out of the \nquestion. You should have seen how the girls and women in \nthe little village of Rimouski hugged her when we got ashore. \n\n&quot;Time and time again I feared Florence would lose her hold, \nand I would speak to her when my mouth and eyes were clear. \nEach time her little hands would clutch me tighter, until it \nseemed she'd stop my breath, but I welcomed the hold be- \ncause it showed she had the pluck and courage needed. \n\n&quot;Poor child! She lost her mother and sister, and only a \nyear ago her father, William Barbour, of Silverstone, was \nkilled. She's alone in the world, but Florence will never need \na friend or home while I have breath in my body.&quot; \n\nBig and rugged as he is, Crellin's eyes grew moist as he \nrecalled how the child's mother and three-year-old sister \nEvelyn were drowned. \n</i></blockquote>","Thank you pennylrichardsca for the moving story behind this photograph.

The team was named by owner Robert Ward, who owned the Tip Top Bakery. They were sometimes called the Brooklyn Feds due to being the Brooklyn team of the Federal League. The Tip Tops played in old Washington Park, which the Brooklyn Dodgers had abandoned after the 1912 season to move to Ebbets Field.\n\nFrom Baseball Encyclopedia.com:\n&quot;With Harry Sinclair, Ward was one of the main backers of the Federal League. As owner of the Brooklyn franchise, he poured more than a million dollars into the cause. He offered to share any team profits with his players, but there was never anything to share.

City of Macon, a 5252 gross ton coastal passenger-cargo ship, was built in 1903 at Chester, Pennsylvania, for the Ocean Steamship Co. of Savannah, which operated a passenger and freight service between Savannah, Georgia, and New York. She was configured like many other coastal passenger ships of her era, among them her near-sister City of Savannah (ID # 4514), with a single smokestack, two raked pole masts, and a long, low superstructure extending from a bridge forward of amidships to the stern. In 1916 the ship was sold to the Barber Steamship Co., renamed Macona, and possibly reconfigured as a freighter by her new owner.\n\nTaken over by the Navy and commissioned at New York as USS Macona (ID # 3305) on 19 August 1918, she sailed in a convoy on 25 August with a cargo of 4,470 tons of general supplies, which she delivered to St. Nazaire, France, on 12 September. She was then assigned to service in European waters, carrying a cargo of potatoes from Ireland to France for the American Expeditionary Force. In late December Macona loaded a cargo of Navy stores, then moved to Cardiff, Wales, to bunker for the voyage back to the United States. She left Cardiff on 15 February 1919 but had to stop at the Azores for more fuel before arriving at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 12 March.

Thanks for including it in your post.","Well, I've looked at them side-by-side a few more times now.  Can't match up any backgrounds, except that both seem to be taken at a ship.  The clothes are almost identical--even the fob-like thing attached to Roy's breast pocket, and the arrangement of Clara's furry stole--but I'm looking again right now and see that Joy's coat is different--could be a lighter layer under the heavier coat here, but maybe it really is just a different day.  Same traveling clothes for most of the party, but a different day.\n\nI like the theory that they're taken at both ends of the same trip, New York and England.  That would make a lot of sense.  The children look the same age/size and are wearing the same hats, etc., so the photo and the footage have to be taken in the same year or so, even if they're not from the same moment.  I assume the children didn't cross the Atlantic more than once or twice a year (but maybe that's my own parenting experience talking!).","Former President Theodore Roosevelt stands on the deck of the steamship Aidan, in New York harbor, on May 19, 1914.
