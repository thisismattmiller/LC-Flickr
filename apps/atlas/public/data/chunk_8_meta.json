During a trip to Europe in 1901, and the resultant exposure to European art museums, reactivated Gertrude’s passion for art. She was particularly interested in sculpture, studied art, and became a sculptress herself. Soon thereafter she became a patron of the arts, promoted the advancement of women in the arts, and organized exhibitions for promising artists. The fountain in the patio of the Pan American building in Washington, D. C. is one of Gertrude’s best known sculptures.\nGertrude’s major and lasting accomplishment of her life was the founding of the Whitney Museum for American Art in 1930. Together with her husband Harry P.

Before reporting what impression it made on the Japanese public let me give a rough sketch of the actual scenes on the occasion. Numberless rows of chairs for the spectators were set along the enclosure of the immense parade ground which was at the same time decorated with innumerable flags representing different nationalities.  The exit of the aeroplanes from the shelter was welcomed by the melodious musical performance of the military band.\n\n     At 2 o'clock His Imperial Highness Prince Higashi Kuni put in an appearance and was saluted by Lieutenant General Nagaoka and Mr Jagawa MP who were respectively appointed to be the president and vice president of the committee hastily created for welcoming Mr Niles. Hundreds of naval and military officers interested in aviation also attended the occasion.\n\n     In the meantime Mr Niles appeared amid cheering of spectators on the scene in a plain aviation suit apparently cheerful and light hearted but composed and self collected.  His manners indicated the great confidence he seemed to place in his capability to conquer any hostile air current that he may meet in the Japanese skies.  A brief examination of the machine having been completed he jumped on Bleriot monoplane which immediately made a steep ascent such as has never been seen in Japan after running about 10 meters on the ground. \n\n      He first drew a large semi circle along the enclosure of ground over the heads of the spectators then from the height of about 500 meters he dashed downward halting on the ground with remarkable agility and lightness.  At 2:40 he swung up again and then after making several rounds at the height of about 1,000 meters accomplished various dangerous feats with wonderful success among which somersaults backward and forward and sidewise were most amazing.  \n\n     Of all the attracting sights that I have seen in the past none surpassed in boldness and manliness and faultlessness what was displayed by Mr Niles.  The same must have been the case with all other spectators Their cheers applause literally &quot;shook the pillars of the firmament and the axis of the earth&quot;  a familiar Japanese expression.  For a moment they lost themselves in ecstasy of admiration over the incredible wonders they have for the first time seen displayed by an American.   One and all as if by previous arrangement shook their hats crying out like people who have gone crazy.\n\n      After about 10 minutes of successive performances Mr Niles made an almost perpendicular dive from an altitude of about 200 meters directly toward the tent in which was Prince Kuni exactly as if it were falling down.   Every spectator held his breath with profound anxiety but soon breathed a sigh of relief when the machine suddenly changed its direction at a point about 10 meters high from the ground and safely landed.   Mr Niles came down with a smiling expression walked towards Prince Kuni with whom he had the honor of shaking hands (a remarkable event in Japan for a blood prince to shake hand with professional aviators).  The prince uttered every eulogy imaginable and gave Mr Niles a wreath as the token of his boundless admiration. \n     The second flight on a Curtis biplane was accomplished with a still greater success overwhelming the populace with infinite amazement .  The name of Mr Niles is now echoing and re-echoing throughout the whole Tokyo. \n\nJapanese have been stunned with astonishment to see such an impossible thing as the somersault of the aeroplane actually practised before their eyes which were accustomed only to the elementary display of Japanese aviators.  They are now ready to admit that in the degree of proficiency attained Mr Niles is as superior to the Oriental aviators as a peak of Alps is to the top of the Tour Eifel in Paris.\n\n      In fact when Mr Niles mounted on the machine it appeared suddenly enlivened with soul.  There was no more of the senseless obstinate machine with which Oriental aviators have much trouble to deal.   In the course of the several dangerous feats there was absolutely no impression of the plane being under the artificial control of the rider but it appeared like a veritable bird flying on its own accord, up and down, right and left, setting at scornful defiance the caprice of the elements much dreaded by the Oriental aviators.\n\n       All the Tokyo papers agree in lavishing admiration and eulogy on the wonderful achievements of Mr Niles.   Some commenced a long statement under the big heading of  &quot;The Magic of the Air.&quot;  Some remarked that even birds would feel abashed at it.   Some described the plane as a fan tossed up in the mid air.  Again another began its sensational article by saying that the sky of Tokyo was conquered by an American aviator.\n\n      Moreover the intelligent public are one in acknowledging the great service Mr Niles has indirectly rendered to the cause of aviation in Japan.   He has shown by his extraordinary dexterity what a wide area is still left for the Japanese aviators to cultivate and that it is possible for human beings to vie with winged creatures in the air by dint of strenuous exertion.   He has also impressed upon the Japanese that aviation is not necessarily a very risky and dangerous business if attended with sufficient skill and proper attention.  \n\n          High officers of the navy and the army who were present on the occasion were one and all extremely pleased to have such brilliant examples shown before the young officers, for one actual instance is better than a hundred oral encouragements.   Japanese are by their nature vehement in the spirit of rivalry.   When they have an act of superiority shown by others they cannot coolly suffer to let them go as permanently superior.   They are ready to tax their capabilities to the utmost even at the cost of their lives to accomplish what they once determined to attain.   And in this light Mr Niles' visit to Japan will be sure to mark a new era in the history of the Japanese aviation just as she was awakened to a new national life by the call of Commodore Perry on the door of her exclusiveism of 300 years.\n\n        In conclusion I should like to note with what an open hearted friendship the Japanese public welcomed the arrival of Mr Niles in Tokyo.   I am sure even the hardest hearted anti-Japanese Americans would be ashamed to talk of the Japanese expulsion any more if only they personally witnessed it.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=V3fmAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=V3fmAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22charles%...</a>","&quot;Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (Russian: Георгий Михайлович) (23 August 1863 – 28 January 1919) was a son of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia and a first cousin of Emperor Alexander III.

Roosevelt was on a 5 week trip to the Caribbean for health reasons.  According to the Times, Teddy greeted Marjorie with, &quot;Hello Mabel, how do you do?

We'll add some of the information to this record the next time we update","After some research and correspondence it appears more than likely that Marjorie Sterrett, of the battleship fund, was born as Marjorie Rockwood Dean in Silver Creek,  Chautauqua Co., New York,  on May 29th. 1902.  Her parents were Fred C. Dean and Grace Rockland, both natives of Erie Co., PA.    \n\nAround 1911, Grace and Fred Dean separated, and Grace remarried Thomas Garfield Sterrett, a native of Erie who was in the newspaper business.  Tom Sterrett was a veteran of the Spanish American War, who had re-enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 1907 and seems to have split his time between New York and Pennsylvania newspaper work and military service.  In the Marines he was employed in recruiting efforts in the years before and during the USA’s entry into World War I.  He is credited with having a genius for publicity and was responsible for staging public events and placing copy in newspapers in order to increase the repute of the Corps.  By 1915, Captain Sterrett was the chief of the Marine Corps’ New York Publicity Bureau on East 24th Street in Manhattan.  Various records and newspaper articles give Brooklyn addresses for himself and/or his family, although they are not shown living there in any of the Federal Censuses.\n\nIn 1916 there was mounting pressure on the non-interventionist Wilson administration to ready the US armed forces for entry into the raging European war.  One of the most visible proponents of “preparedness” was former president Theodore Roosevelt.  It is against this background that Captain Sterrett’s pretty 13-year-old stepdaughter wrote her moving letter to the New York Tribune offering up her dime allowance to help build a battleship for the Navy.  Within a very short amount of time she was standing on the deck of the SS Guiana schmoozing with the ailing Roosevelt who very publicly had embraced Marjorie’s cause and contributed dimes on behalf of his young grandchildren.  (I find it curious that Bain didn’t archive a photo of TR and Marjorie together although they each are shown separately on board the ship.)\n\nMarjorie’s letter generated a great deal of publicity across the US and bolstered the public acceptance of a pro-war stance.  There were deep-seated suspicions that the war was being fought for the benefit of munitions manufacturers and profiteers, and that the US should stay out of Europe’s mess.  Marjorie’s act provided a patriotic subtext for the hawks of that day.  The fact that her stepfather was a PR man for the armed forces was not discussed in the coverage of the story.\n\nSometime after she burst upon the public scene, Marjorie was invited to make some short films for the Edison Company.   Her film career never took off and, rather soon, was living quietly with her parents Thomas and Grace Sterrett back in Erie.  Tom Sterrett returned to the newspaper publishing business after the conclusion of the War, and by the late 1920’s had been elected Sherriff of Erie County PA.   In 1920, Marjorie (under the name Marjorie Rockwood Dean) was married to Peter Raun in Erie, with whom she had several children.  Marjorie died at the age of 24 in Wattsburg, Erie Co. PA on March 2, 1927.\n\nSee also: <a href=\"http://oldtimeerie.blogspot.com/2013/11/naval-award-named-for-erie-girl_10.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">oldtimeerie.blogspot.com/2013/11/naval-award-named-for-er...</a>","Thank you so much for filling in a bit more of the story, puzzlemaster.

With his wife Adele McGinnis, also an artist and heir, he built a pink stucco villa overlooking a pond flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean. When asked why his house and garden were reminiscent of Sicily, Albert Herter answered, &quot;It is perhaps the sea; and I am sure our three Sicilian workmen are also responsible.&quot; The house had color-themed gardens: a blue and white terrace, and this orange-and-yellow court with continuous bloom; tulips and crocus in April, climbing yellow roses in May and June, followed by yellow phlox and orange-yellow Sweet William, dahlias, trumpet vine, and zinnias. A gray fog softened the floral brilliance when Johnston photographed the house in the early fall.

Preston, (1860-1938), served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1890-1894. He was Mayor of Baltimore for two terms from 1911-1919. He was defeated when seeking a third term in 1919, and resumed the practice of law.\n\nPreston graduated from the Law School of the University of Maryland in 1881 with an LL.B. degree. In 1894 he married Miss Helen Fiske Jackson (b.1874), the daughter of Wilbur Fiske Jackson (1849-1903), and niece of Governor Elihu E. Jackson (1837-1907).  They had two sons and three daughters.\n\nMayor Preston was in the national news throughout 1914 as he was the president of the centennial commission directing impressive ceremonies as the people of the United States observed the 100th anniversary of the birth of the immortal anthem, <i>&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot;</i> From July 8 to August 1, 1914, Commission President Mayor Preston toured dozens of major American cities by rail on a good will, centennial promotional tour.\n\nPresident Wilson and former Presidents Taft and Roosevelt, vice presidents, former Governors of Maryland, the former Mayors of Baltimore along with the present Governors of the eighteen states in the union when Francis Scott Key wrote his national anthem, attended the ceremonies at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, September 6-13, 1914. \n\n6,500 public school children formed a <a href=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5ik1laQMR1qgikbdo1_1280.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">human flag</a> on a special platform built for the occasion, followed by singing of the National Anthem accompanied by a 250 piece marching band.

He turned to Segurola and said: &quot;Too bad, too bad. She's not In good voice today, and anyhow she has made a poor selection of songs.&quot; '\n  Segurola, who is said to have a great personal Interest ln Miss Fltziu. objected strongly, saying that Thorner had no right to utter such criticisms,\n  One word led to another, and the smart audience suddenly saw Thorner jump to his feet and pump rlght and left rapidly Into Segurola's face. The opera singer clinched, and the two men thrashed around the room. Then Mlss Kitziu ran to them and managed to quell the battle. She soothed Begurola's injured face, for the singer's eye was badly swollen.\n  Later ln the day the quarrel between the two men was patched up.\n  When Miss Kltzlu was playing In &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at the Park Theater it was reported that she was engaged to Dave Montgomery of Montgomery and Stone.

But he used a very different method to achieve color photographs. The technique involved multiple exposures of the same scene through blue, green, and red filters; then, combining the three images into a single, full color scene--either printed on paper, or, projected like a slide. This tricolor method was more time consuming than an autochrome, but it yielded vivid, lifelike color. \n\nFor a full description of how the tricolor method worked, see <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/process.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/process.html</a> and <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html</a>, which includes a picture of the camera. -- Helena (LOC)","Many thanks for your brilliant explanation.","how great is this!","Oh yes thank you for explaining this amazing color image processing... \nit is a wonderful informative cultural life capture... thanks for sharing!!!\nWishing you a blessed Labor Day!!!","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52883355787/in/photolist-2oz82fk-2oz9qoR\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52883355787/in/photolist-...</a>","paraíso","View in 2012: <a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/photo/89694548\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.panoramio.com/photo/89694548</a>","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52883966693/in/photolist-2oz8SJp-2oz9GYU-2ozaMtz-2ozaN9N-2ozb9Rc\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52883966693/in/photolist-...</a>","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52882734687/\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52882734687/</a>","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52883758383/\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52883758383/</a>","three shots, three different exposures, awesome!","they are not different exposures.

Its technique that allowed him to shoot colour before colour film was made. Look at his other work and you will get how tricolor works :)","It is one sheet of glass (roughly 10 inches by 3 inches) but three different exposures. Each &quot;frame&quot; was exposed separately as the glass plate negative &quot;dropped&quot; past the camera lens. There's enough time separation between the 3 exposures, with the plate rocking a bit left to right and backward and forward, that aligning the 3 images to create a single color 'composite' is challenging. That's also what causes the streaks of yellow, magenta, and cyan, where the blue, green, and red-filtered areas don't overlap completely..  \n\nBlaise Aguera y Arcas figured out an exposure time from a photo that includes the moon: &quot;Given the radius of the moon, its distance from the Earth, and its period of revolution, it can be calculated that the moon moves across the Earth's sky by its own diameter in about 2.1 minutes. The moon is visible in several of the Prokudin-Gorskii plates. The example above is especially clear. The animation alternates between &quot;warped&quot; color reconstructions based on the green exposure and the red exposure. Between the two exposures, the moon moves by more than 1/6 of its diameter, so it would appear that each exposure took upward of 20 seconds; the whole photo would have taken over a minute. From the brightness of the sky and the fairly short shadows, we can assume that this photo was taken during broad daylight. On an overcast day, the exposure would need to have been longer; indoors, much longer.&quot;  Photo, <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/item/prk2000000241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/item/prk2000000241/</a> \n\nFor a full description of how the color method worked, see <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/process.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/process.html</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html</a> (which includes a picture of the camera).\n\nHelena (LOC)","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress] Fantastic!

The coat of the young man in the center, for example, comes out as green when you process the shot, yet here it is grey; in effect, it has been de-saturated. I would ask the Library too, whether it has considered re-scanning the glass plates.

People forget that while 19th and early 20th century photography was cumbersome and primitive, by current standards, lenses, by contrast, had already undergone a couple of centuries of development, thus, the detail possibly captured by old photographs is often astonishing, as good as, or better than current digital efforts. Speed Graflex images, for example, if scanned at even 1500dpi, can easily yield a detailed, 40 megapixel image. And as with Prokudin-Gorskii, I'm willing to bet that more detail yet can be recovered from such images by scanning in the 4800dpi range.

Here's an account of Cowdin's life with more information about the importance of the event pictured here:\n\n&quot;In December of 1915 Cowdin and fellow countrymen Norman Prince and William Thaw were granted a month's permission to America. They arrived in New York on 23 December aboard the SS Rotterdam. Their furlough, though intended as &quot;a short rest&quot;, furthered the cause for an American squadron when the Government of France realized the interest the three American volunteers had created during their visit to the United States. The pilots became the focus of the eastern press who doggedly pursued them in spite of their reluctance to speak of their duties. Both sides of the European War seized upon the press coverage: the Allied supporters citing the flyers' example in a plea for America's intervention, while German sympathizers condemned their participation as a violation of U.S. neutrality and demanded their internment. Upon their return to France, the three Americans' desire to form an all-American squadron was enhanced as the French Government realized that just such an organization would be useful in galvanizing America's sympathy for their cause.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://rdisa.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/Pages/Elliot%20Cowdin%20EN.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">rdisa.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/Pages/Elliot%20Cowdin%20E...</a>\n\n\nSee also:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9574733941/\" title=\"E.

There was ecstatic applause after each of the first two tableaux and more at the end of the opera. The singers were again and again recalled. Mr. Granados came frequently; Mr. Periquet came; Messrs. Setti, Spech and Bavagnoli came, and none was left unhonored. Vast wreaths were given the two authors of the opera, a bronze one to Mr. Granados. The applause on this occasion doubtless had much of the fictitious value of first-night applause, to which was added the element of national pride. But there seemed to be evidence to show that the brilliantly exotic little opera-it lasts hardly an hour-had really made an impression an the general public, and that it may turn out to have more than the transitory attraction of many new additions to the operatic list.&quot;\n\nSee notes under <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9577520148/\" title=\"E.

The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold at the end of the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore.

Part of the text on an historical marker nearby:\n\nIn New York, a prominent group of citizens formed a Joan of Arc monument committee in 1909. Their efforts coincided with those of a young sculptor, Anna Hyatt Huntington, to create a sculpture of Joan. Her first version, in which she emphasized “the spiritual rather than the warlike point of view,” was submitted to the prestigious Salon in Paris. It received an honorable mention from the jury, nevertheless skeptical that such an accomplished work of art could have been made solely by a woman.\n\nThe New York monument committee, headed by J. Sanford Saltus, was so impressed by her work, that they awarded her the commission. Architect John van Pelt was retained to design the pedestal, which is made of Mohegan granite composed of Gothic-style blind arches, decorated with coats of arms. A few limestone blocks from the tower in Rouen where Joan of Arc had been imprisoned were incorporated into the base. Van Pelt situated the monument at the top of the steps in the park island at 93rd Street and Riverside, and had planted a screen of trees to disguise the buildings.\n\nHuntington’s version is both heroic and infused with naturalistic detail. For Joan’s armor, she conducted research at the arms and armory division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the refinement of the equine anatomy was based on a horse borrowed from the fire department of her native town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her niece posed astride a barrel, as she modeled the figure, first nude, then in costume.\n\nOn December 6, 1915, the sculpture was unveiled in an elaborate ceremony, which included a military band and French Ambassador Jean J. Jusserand. Mrs. Thomas Alva Edison was among those selected to pull the cord that released the shroud. Huntington went on to have a long and illustrious career, and also sculpted the statue of the Cuban patriot, José Martí (1965), which stands at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas. A replica of Joan of Arc stands in front of the Palace of the Legion of Honor in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco.\n\nIn 1939, Parks repaired Joan’s sword, which had been broken, repatined the bronze statue, and repaired the staircase. In 1987, the sculpture again underwent a full conservation financed by the Grand Marnier Foundation through the Municipal Art Society’s Adopt-A-Monument Program.","<a href=\"http://newyorkcitystatues.com/joan-of-arc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">newyorkcitystatues.com/joan-of-arc/</a>\n\nNow mostly hidden by trees: <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Riverside+Drive+at+93rd+Street+New+York&amp;hl=de&amp;sll=40.794796,-73.976268&amp;sspn=0.000607,0.001032&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Riverside+Dr+&amp;+W+93rd+St,+New+York,+10025&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.79429,-73.976834&amp;cbp=13,124.75,,0,-6.02&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;panoid=Utipz9Bfmso80ApCoR5Kcw&amp;ll=40.784457,-73.971462&amp;spn=0.020406,0.048237&amp;z=14&amp;source=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Streetview</a>\n\nRecent photo:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thesmileinn/7174790067/\" title=\"Joan of Arc Monument in Riverside Park by (monica), on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7213/7174790067_7217277cbb_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Joan of Arc Monument in Riverside Park\" /></a>\n\nThe sculptor, Anna Hyatt Huntington:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9473052154/\" title=\"Anna Vaughn Hyatt  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2858/9473052154_4240d160b3_m.jpg\" width=\"174\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Anna Vaughn Hyatt  (LOC)\" /></a>","French ambassador to the United States, he spoke at the dedication of the equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in Riverside Park, New York, December 6, 1915.","Jean Adrien Antoine Jules Jusserand (18 February 1855 – 18 July 1932) was a French author and diplomat.

She held editorial positions with the Delineator in 1907-1908, Woman's Magazine from 1908 to 1912, and the Housekeeper in 1913.\n\nFollowing her career as a writer and editor, she founded her own New York-based editorial consulting and public relations firm, through which she met the Hungarian pacifist Rosika Schwimmer in 1914. Leckie managed Schwimmer's 1914-1915 United States lecture tour, contracting with women's clubs and pacifist organizations in over twenty states across the country to schedule Schwimmer as a speaker. The 1915 season was cut short, however, due to both women's attendance at the International Congress of Women at The Hague, and their involvement with the Henry Ford Peace Expedition of 1915-1916.\nLeckie was hired as public relations and press manager for the Ford Peace Expedition, although her duties stretched far beyond public relations. In particular, she contributed to the process of selecting and courting guests for the expedition, and brought on the four female journalists who accompanied the voyage.\n\nFollowing her time with the Ford Expedition, Leckie served as organizer of news distribution for the Conservation Division of the Food Administration in Washington D.C. in 1917, and the director of publicity for the Y.W.C.A. Free Milk for France campaign of 1918.\n\nKatherine Leckie passed away in 1930.&quot;\n\nfrom biographical material associated with Katherine Leckie's papers in the collections of the New York Public Library.    <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/leckie.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/...</a>","Awesome","puzzlemaster:  Thanks so much for the background information on Katherine Leckie.

During his career, he played for the New York Highlanders (1905–1913), Chicago White Sox (1913–1914), Buffalo Blues (1914–1915), Cincinnati Reds (1916–1918), and New York Giants (1919).\n\nNo lesser figures than Babe Ruth and Walter Johnson named him the best first baseman ever, and contemporary reports describe his glovework as outstanding. He is sometimes considered the first true star of the franchise that would eventually become the New York Yankees. In 1981, 62 years after his last major league game, baseball historians Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.\n\nDespite being an excellent hitter and his reputation as a peerless defensive player, Chase's legacy was tainted by a litany of corruption.

Soon, he was invited to Greece to resolve the political deadlock and became the country's Prime Minister. \nNot only did he initiate constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society, but also reorganized both army and navy in preparation of future conflicts. Before the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, Venizelos' catalytic role helped gain Greece entrance to the Balkan League, an alliance of the Balkan states against Ottoman Turkey. \nThrough his diplomatic acumen, Greece doubled her area and population with the liberation of Macedonia, Epirus, and the rest of the Aegean islands.","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos</a>","His wikipedia entry:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwent_Hall_Caine\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwent_Hall_Caine</a>","AGO DV.3\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGO_DV.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGO_DV.3</a>","Lovely shot and makes you marvel at those who took to the air in such flimsy machines!","Beautiful","Lovely  waterfall and lanscape that  can be seen when enlaged.Excellent photographic techniques that can be seen and accepted.","Hermosa; magnifica","Newstead Abbey was the home of the famous English poet, Lord Byron.

When I looked him up in the CW database, I found a Philip Nail in the 13th NC Infantry.  I thought both possibilities were wrong because of the lone &quot;3&quot; on his hat.  I never even thought about the fact that the 3rd NC Volunteers were the same as the 13th NC Infantry.  I believe this soldier is absolutely Philip Nail of the 13th NC Infantry.","Thanks.

A joint British and French operation was mounted to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (Istanbul) and secure a sea route to Russia.[6] Following an unsuccessful naval campaign to force a passage through the Dardanelles, an amphibious landing was undertaken on the Gallipoli peninsula. The attempt failed after eight months of heavy fighting and many casualties on both sides; the force was finally evacuated.

He was railroader and lost both arms in two accidents. Then he studied law.","&quot;THE ARMLESS JUDGE\nTen years ago David Moylan was a railroad switchman workin in a Cleveland yard.  A switch engine running in the dark without a headlight ran him down and cut off both his arms.  That would have settled the fate of most men.  And it did settled Moylan's fate--but not in the usual way.  He firmly declined to pass the rest of his life in a state of semi-dependence on his relatives, or hold a tin cup for charitable nickels.  Since he was disabled physically, Moylan decided to earn a living with his brains.  They were good brains, although it had never occurred to him before to make much use of them.  He had a pretty fluent tongue too.  So the switchman made up his mind to be a lawyer.  As soon as he got out of the hospital, Moylan bought a copy of Blackstone.  He read it by turning the leaves with his tongue.  He learned to write with his teeth.  In three years he passed the state law examinations for admission to the bar, ranking among the first ten in a class of 205.  That was seven years ago.  Attorney Moylan has made a fair living ever since.  But now he is Judge Moylan.  On November 2d he was elected to the Cleveland municipal bench.  And his professional brethren say that he'll make a mighty good judge.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95060914/1915-11-19/ed-1/seq-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95060914/1915-11-19/ed-...</a>","Posting at the same time--I was so interested in the story I had to transcribe it!","This photo was used in an article on Judge Moylan in the June, 1916 Popular Science Monthly\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=didRAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA816&amp;ots=zpAKSQyINa&amp;dq=david%20moylan%20judge&amp;pg=PA816#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20moylan%20judge&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=didRAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA816&amp;...</a>","Eleanor Wilson McAdoo, Woodrow Wilson's daughter:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5208802689/]\nHer husband:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8747718274/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2635666951/]\nHer father with her child:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8124806113/]","Secretary of the Treasury, and the president's son-in-law;  Woodrow Wilson's daughter Eleanor was his second wife.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibbs_McAdoo\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibbs_McAdoo</a>","The happy couple:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5558110235/\" title=\"W.G.

On 16 May they left for the longest leg of their journey, to the Azores. NC-1 and the NC-3 were both forced to land in heavy seas due to dense fog, and neither could take off again.

He later became commander of the Dardanelles Expeditionary Force 1915, and in 1920 published his two-volume Gallipoli Diary.

The pair of peaks in the centre are the Langdale Pikes.  The left one of the pair is Pike of Stickle and the right one is Harrison Stickle.  Behind it, to the right, is Pavey Ark.  The steep valley coming down the nearer side of Harrison Pike is Dungeon Ghyll.  The view is taken from Kettle Crag I think, looking NNW. The long sloping shoulder on the L is The Band - well known hikers' slog up on to Bow Fell (out of view to L), or knee-breaking descent from same.  The ridge on the skyline is Rossett Pike.  These mountains always look impressively Alpine in views like this, in spite of being only about 700-800 m a.s.l.  Langdale is a classic glaciated valley with Pavey Ark above it, a classic glaciated cirque (aka corrie, cwm) with the Dungeon Ghyll a classic hanging valley - all text-book examples.  The rocky topography is formed in Ordovician volcanics dating from when the Lake District was part of an island arc.  (Lake District place names are truly poetic - many of them are said to be Norse origin, from when the Vikings settled the area.)","This is a stunningly beautiful image!","I agree, I went to boarding school in Windermere for 10 years surrounded by these views and I never got immune to the beauty of it.  I returned a few years ago and it was just as stunning.","<a href=\"http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=+54%c2%b036'44.02&quot;N+++2%c2%b049'19.82&quot;W&amp;aq=&amp;sll=54.608714,-2.823529&amp;sspn=0.021847,0.066047&amp;t=h&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=54.6122,-2.822026&amp;panoid=VyWaVXj5oJ8cDeX-SuZedA&amp;cbp=11,222.57,,0,-1.05&amp;ll=54.603308,-2.822199&amp;spn=0.015611,0.048237&amp;z=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Street View</a>","Really nice","*Invitation by Admin/Moderators:\n\n<b>Congratulations!

Touche\nFounder\n\nGeorge A. Touche apprenticed as an accountant in Edinburgh before traveling to London and qualifying as a chartered accountant in 1883. After practicing for six years, he was appointed secretary of the Industrial and General Trust. This appointment was his first involvement with investment trusts, a field in which he would become an acknowledged expert.\n\nAlthough best remembered for the accounting companies he founded, Touche was also deeply involved in civic life. He was a member of Parliament for North Islington from 1910 to 1918. In recognition of his many achievements, Touche was knighted in 1917 and appointed a baronet three years later.\n\nTouche was actually born with the surname Touch (pronounced in Scotland to rhyme with &quot;loch&quot;). But his name, when mispronounced &quot;Tutch&quot; by the English, had negative connotations. The Oxford Standard Dictionary gave one definition of &quot;touch&quot; as &quot;to wheedle a sum of money out of someone,&quot; which Touche felt was hardly appropriate for an accountant. In 1906, therefore, he changed his name to Touche, its ancient Scottish spelling.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/About/History/Leaders-Shapers/ffc8855bb41fb110VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/About/History/Leaders-Shap...</a>","&quot;Frederick William MacMonnies (September 28, 1863 – March 22, 1937) was the best known expatriate American sculptor of the Beaux-Arts school, as successful and lauded in France as he was in the United States.

I did not post to address your counterpoint that, &quot;LOC does a great service by posting images from its unique collection.&quot;\n\nI never denied that, and since it is not my point of contention, your using it as a response misses my point.\n\nMy point is the LOC does the world outside the U.S. a disservice by leaving out essential, basic information like Woodrow Wilson's first name, and assuming we are all familiar with the famous U.S. presidents. Basic stuff and they can't even get that right.

Congratulations, you've made an insulting, derogatory remark about a person you'e never met. The point you miss is that it is the LOC's job to provide these details.

That is condescending language, dude. If you want to talk to me, then talk to me by addressing me directly, engaging me in conversation the way you would if we were in the same room instead of addressing me in the third person.\n\nTalk to me, don't talk at me.","Arbo, I suspect that they put up so many photos that they just use the info that is on the photo, like &quot;Wilson at Princeton,&quot; which is actually written on the photo (or provided along with it in notes or whatever), and that it's possibly interns who are uploading the photos to Flickr, and the person doing the uploading might not actually know any more info than is provided. It's lovely that other Flickr users have been so great about providing more info, but I've tried finding info on old photos, and it can be very time consuming. The LOC often uploads many, many photos in a day, and this number would be considerably fewer if they researched each photo as they uploaded it. I would also love to see more info along with each photo; I'm just guessing that the amount of photos makes it difficult. I doubt very much they are trying to be American-centric; trust me, plenty of Americans would not recognize a photo of Woodrow Wilson either. Like I said, I suspect it's a case of too many photos, not enough time or resources to research each one.","Thanks for chipping in. That all sounds plausible. It would be much better if somebody at the LOC explained what's going on, instead of guess work from flickr users.\n\nPutting quantity above quality cheapens the whole exercise.","I'll keep it short -\nAs I was looking at the LOC site I 'presumed' Wilson was Woodrow Wilson, although I would not have recoginised him from the image alone. I understand that the title is as the script on the photo but it would be beneficial to others to ID the person depicted.\nFurther info. is then up to the viewer to research.\n\nPeter\nA Brit., not an historian or with a great interest in US political history but with a fascination for old images!!","arbo: the following will hopefully address your questions about our approach to this collection with respect to how the captions were handled. It was written by the chief of the Prints &amp; Photographs Division.  Additionally, please see our webpage of frequently asked questions about the Flickr project in general: <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/flickr_pilot_faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/rr/print/flickr_pilot_faq.html</a>\n\nIn 2004-06, the Prints &amp; Photographs Division was delighted to receive enough funding to scan all 40,000 glass negatives in the Bain Collection. (See <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/digitizing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/digitizing.html</a>.) The funding also had limits, and we had to find an expeditious way to provide basic captions. Rather than decipher and transcribe the handwritten titles and dates directly from the glass plates (very time consuming and thus costly), we relied on a typed set of caption cards that Library staff had made some decades ago by looking at the Bain company’s handwritten index cards as well as notes on the paper sleeves that housed the negatives. \n\nThe information on the Bain caption cards and sleeves was not always identical to the info on the negatives, but it was usually quite close. We tried to be explicit about the “incomplete” aspects of the titles by putting a note in each record to indicate the preliminary nature of the information: &quot;Title from unverified data provided by the Bain News Service on the negatives or caption cards.&quot;\n\nHaving the digital images go online was a foundation step that made future projects possible. People could now more easily compare the titles on the negatives and the information from the caption cards by enlarging the photo image to see the letters on the negative clearly. Then, flesh out abbreviations, correct misspellings, and add subject information. That’s where the Flickr project has made such an important contribution–the reconciliation and verification of data is now well underway! Some 9,000 Bain photos are in Flickr, which means far better captions for almost 25% of the collection already.","The magic of the Internet! \nThank you LOC for posting great images to Flickr.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryan_loc] Glad to hear all that. Thank you for the explanatory information.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate the collaborative approach to these things. I just have great expectations.","Since you asked, it's worth mentioning two more things ....  \n\n(1) Flickr opened The Commons in large part so that people could contribute better information about the pictures in many libraries, archives, and museums. Pictures with limited descriptions and institutions with limited resources are all too common. (See <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/commons/\">www.flickr.com/commons/</a> )   \nIf you enjoy seeing how picture puzzles are solved, the National Library of Ireland photostream is well worth a look at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/\">www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/</a> \n\n(2) We incorporate the valuable new information that Flickr members provide into the catalog records at the Library of Congress pretty quickly, along with a link that connects to the longer narrative comments in Flickr.  But we aren't too often able to re-load those improved records back into Flickr. Also, the new, fuller info might be in a subject note rather than the title; we leave the title as the Bain News Service provided it unless their information is completely wrong.  Here's a typical example of an updated record that was reloaded to Flickr in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ggb2005014062/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ggb2005014062/</a> \n\nPlease keep the improved descriptions coming!\nHelena (LOC)","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/70251312@N00] Thanks!

The mystery of the difference in the image dates and the Mare Island event are now solved, as well as why the event was one year off from the generally chronological order of the Bain photos. The image I linked to above, of course, is from the Mare Island event in October, 1916.\n\nA ship's history provided by the New Mexico Council of the Navy League of the United States has this to say about the building of the ship, which was ultimately involved in many battles in the Pacific Theater of WWII:\n\n&quot;Authorized by an Act of Congress dated June 30, 1914, construction of Battleship 40 was allocated to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and begun in October 1915. At first scheduled to bear the name CALIFORNIA, the huge finished product was officially labeled USS NEW MEXICO as she plunged down greased ways on April 23, 1917. Sponsor at the elegant launching ceremonies was Miss Margaret C de Baca, daughter of New Mexico’s Governor Ezequiel Cabeza de Baca. For Miss C de Baca and for the state of New Mexico (the first time a U.S. Navy ship had been named NEW MEXICO), it was a red letter day.\n\nWar-built battleship NEW MEXICO constituted at that time the prime example of engineering prowess, of U.S. naval architectural know-how. Rising ominously from the NEW MEXICO’s deck in a 2-A-2 gun arrangement were four massive steel turrets, each built up entirely of flat armor plates and housing a trio of 14-inch rifles. Most of the 5-inch guns in her secondary battery were spotted strategically in drier positions at upper deck level. Submerged below the waterline were two 21-inch torpedo tubes. Two popular-like cage masts adorned the 624-foot hull (16 feet longer than any previous BB class). Improved compartmentation and the substitution of a graceful clipper bow with bulbous forefoot for the ram bow of earlier capital ships were outstanding features.\n\nHowever, top innovation of all came when the NEW MEXICO was singled out to be the first turboelectric-driven battleship. Prompted by the successful record of the fleet collier JUPITER, pioneer in electric propulsion, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels put his official O.K. on an order to outfit the NEW MEXICO with four mammoth General Electric motors. They would operate the NEW MEXICO’s four propellers and enable her to make her accredited 21 knots.\n\nOld time sailors and engineers were quick to voice strong opposition in letters, telegrams and interviews, and soon had the controversy before the House Naval Committee. “It is bound to prove an expensive failure,” argued the protesting experts, “so let some other nation try it first.” The decision of the Committee put the decision squarely up to Secretary Daniels.&quot;\n\nMore at: <a href=\"http://www.ussnewmexico.net/bb40-history/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ussnewmexico.net/bb40-history/</a>","See also <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8643404448/\" title=\"Laying Keel of U.S.S. \"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8643404448_3409925b5e_m.jpg\" width=\"164\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Laying Keel of U.S.S. \" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8643404548/\" title=\"Adm.

Capt Lamb was the commander of an anti-smuggling revenue cutter, the Stag, who courted Ms Boys, of Hawkhurst, despite the opposition of her father. She was staying at Fairlight Place, so the pair could only meet in secret at Lovers Seat when the captain’s vessel was off that part of the coast. After marrying, the couple lived happily for 28 years until the captain died at sea. There have been many romanticised versions of this story, not least because Lovers Seat was a most unusual and attractive spot for lovers of all kinds to meet. What became known as the ‘seat’ was a slab of sandstone rock at the highest clifftop point between Fairlight and Warren Glens. It projected out over a secluded bench, about 20 feet below, where lovers could come together. A major cliff-fall in 1961 removed the slab, the bench and the surrounding clifftop.&quot;\n\nPosition: <a href=\"https://maps.google.ch/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=+50%c2%b052'2.22&quot;N,+++0%c2%b038'0.96&quot;E&amp;aq=&amp;sll=50.883326,0.550003&amp;sspn=0.189527,0.528374&amp;t=h&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google maps</a>","<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=50.8543,0.578&amp;aq=&amp;sll=50.854197,0.578005&amp;sspn=0.011853,0.033023&amp;t=h&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=50.854617,0.580296&amp;panoid=9hbdvBmrNsAn7k_MLpYtbg&amp;cbp=13,284.56,,0,-11.35&amp;ll=50.849754,0.580301&amp;spn=0.017016,0.048237&amp;z=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Street View</a>","See comments and further images etc here -\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet/6465618493/]","View in 2007: <a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/photo/11713908\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.panoramio.com/photo/11713908</a>","Very similar photo from the same period in <i>The Castles of England</i> by MACKENZIE, James Dixon:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11241242973/\" title=\"Image taken from page 113 of 'The Castles of England: their story and structure ...

It is among the earliest and most elaborate of a chain of coastal forts, which also includes Calshot, Camber,Walmer and Pendennis Castles. Most were built at great speed between 1539 and 1542 by order of King Henry VIII, who feared an invasion by the Catholic powers of Europe. Its squat, rounded turrets were designed to deflect incoming cannon balls, and acted as platforms from which to fire barrages from increasingly sophisticated artillery pieces.\nThe fort guarded the sheltered anchorage of ‘the Downs’ – the stretch of water between the shore and the hazardous Goodwin Sands, a graveyard of ships. Today you can explore the whole of the castle from the storerooms to the first-floor captain’s residence.

Their relentless efforts saved Warren Pershing.\n\nAn investigation, which was started during the day by a board of inquiry appointed by\nMajor H.H. Whitney, commanding officer, established the fact that the fire started from\nan open grate in the dining room, which was left piled hight with living coals when Mrs.\nPershing and Mrs. Church retired shortly before midnight.\n\nBrigadier-General John J. Pershing returned to San Francisco Sunday morning, August 29,\nbowed, haggard, silent.\n\nHe went at once to the undertaking parlors at Geary and Divisadero streets and for \nhalf an hour remained alone with the bodies of his wife and his three little girls, Ann,\nHelen and Margaret, who perished in the Presidio fire.\n\nFrom this flower filled room he went to look at the ruin of his house in the Presidio.\n\nHe walked through the black and empty rooms and saw the bare beds and the path that\nthe flames had taken in the night.\n\nHe then went to the Letterman Hospital. Here he was greeted wit loving arms and the \nfamiliar cry of &quot;pape, papa.&quot; His son Warren, 5 years old, the only one left, was waiting \nfor him.  They were left alone. The only thing that has consoled the boy in these last\ntwo days has been the fact that &quot;papa is coming.&quot; His father had telegraphed him.\n\nThe General returned to the Stewart Hotel for a brief rest. At 1:30, accompanied by\nMajor-General Murray and the officers of the army post, he went to Gray's undertaking\nchapel, Geary and Divisadero streets, where Episcopal funeral services were conducted.\nThe Rev. Dr. Edward Morgan, rector of St. Luke's Church, officiated.\n\nWhile the services were in progress a crowd of close to a thousand gathered in front\nof the chapel. General Pershing and his party left immediately after the services.\n\nAn hour after the services the caskets containing the bodies of Mrs. Pershing and her \nthree daughters were borne by the non-commissioned officers to two motor hearses outside the chapel. The caskets were in white cases, prepared for shipment.\n\nSix honorary pallbearers marched before them as they were being carried to the hearses.\n\nThe non-commissioned officers acting as body-bearers did not march beside the hearses\nuntil the ferry was reached.  They then formed in line and accompanied the hearses aboard\nthe ferryboat Alameda, which left a 3:20 to connect with the Overland Limited. The train\ndrew out of the Oakland mole at 4 o'clock.\n\nAccompanying General Pershing on his way to Cheyenne for the burial were his son\nWarren, Senator and Mrs. Warren, parents of Mrs. Pershing, and Mr. and Mrs. Frederick\nWarren.\n\nsource: <i>(The (Placerville, California) Mountain Democrat, Sept 4, 1915, page 4</i>","Charles Richard Crane (1858-1939), businessman and expert on Arab culture;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Richard_Crane\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Richard_Crane</a>","pennylrichardsca:  Thank you for the additional information on Charles Crane.

Painted circa 1920, Gwendolyn Lucy Maitland stands full-length holding a bouquet of blue irises and dressed in an ephemeral white gown. From the early 1920's the countess wintered in Palm Beach, Florida and at the time this portrait was made, she was already considered one of the leading figures of Palm Beach society. In 1926 she was even awarded the keys to the city of Fort Lauderdale, a city which she had claimed one of her ancestors had founded. She was one of the original investors of a real-estate venture in 1925 involving the development of a Broward county community north of Fort Lauderdale called Floranada. Conceived by her American ancestor Major William Lauderdale, the venture failed, most likely precipitating the sale of the painting along with other Lauderdale treasures.&quot;","The note on the right of the negative &quot;Mrs. H.

The Ivanhoe Baths were created in 1822 to cash in. The water came from existing saline springs at Moira, some four miles away. The plan was to pipe it in, but this proved too expensive, so it was transported by canal and later railway for storage in a huge underground tank here. The large building contained various single-sex baths, pump room, billiard room, card rooms and the main saloon under a huge dome. For a while the spa flourished, which led to a theatre being built in 1828 in Bath Street and a racecourse in 1835 near Leicester Road. The Winter Gardens held all sorts of concerts and events and town businesses thrived. However, the town failed to gain 'fashionable' status and despite a grand revival in 1887, the baths fell into decline and closed in the early 20th century. The shell of the elegant building which once stood here was finally pulled down by the council in 1962.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Bath_Grounds_and_the_Ivanhoe_Baths_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1524428.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Bath_Grounds_and_the_...</a>\n\nMany photos of the Ivanhoe baths, including its demolition, at \n<a href=\"http://ashbydelazouchmuseum.org.uk/photographs.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">ashbydelazouchmuseum.org.uk/photographs.php</a>","artolog:  Thank you for the interesting history of this site.

The name Kawachi comes from Kawachi Province, now a part of Osaka prefecture.\nKawachi had a sister ship, the Settsu, which had a clipper bow as opposed to the straight bow of the Kawachi.\nAn explosion in the ammunition magazine of the skip sank the Kawachi on 12 July 1918, with the loss of 621 officers and crew.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Kawachi\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Kawachi</a>","It looks like American, British and Japanese sailor uniforms didn't vary much.","This is Kendo.","The kanji reads from right to left: &quot;(Life in the Navy,)&quot; &quot;Fencing aboard a battle ship,&quot; and &quot;(No duplication allowed).&quot;","Thanks, Linda.  I think if  the Bain people could read kanji, they would have crossed out &quot;no duplication allowed&quot;... I sense they may not have been great respecters of copyright.","Cool.","Oh Kendo...","!!","another Japanese pre-drednought built in the UK at the Clyde shipyards\n\nThe Asahi was a pre\ndreadnought battleship in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Built at the same time as the Shikishima class battleships, and with virtually identical specifications. However, the Shikishima class vessels had three smokestacks, whereas Asahi had only two, thus giving her a distinctive silhouette. Complement: 836 \n\nThe name Asahi means rising sun, which by extension is a metaphor for Japan.\n\nAsahi was laid down by Clydebank Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Company, and completed by John Brown &amp; Company. Upon her launch, she was the heaviest battleship yet built on the Clyde. Her delivery in 1900 was delayed when the vessel ran aground as she left for Japan. Stores and ammunition were removed, the ship pulled clear, and after an inspection in drydock she proceeded to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 23 Oct 1900.\n\nshe survived all the way into WWII\n\n<a href=\"http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=5173\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=5173</a>","grace!","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Ikoma\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Ikoma</a>","grace!","nice photo friend","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_class_battlecruiser\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_class_battlecruiser</a>","in her early configuration, nearly unrecognizable compared to this post 1929, originally a battle cruiser, she was redesigned as a fast battleship with an enormous pagoda superstructure","grace!","Lots of UK factories converted to munitions manufacture during WWI and hired women.

Wittelsbach was the first capital ship built under the Navy Law of 1898, brought about by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.\nThe ship served in the I Squadron of the German fleet for the majority of her career. Wittelsbach was rapidly superseded by new &quot;all-big-gun&quot; warships, and as a result served for less than eight years before being decommissioned on 20 September 1910. After the start of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces, though the threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw by 1916.
