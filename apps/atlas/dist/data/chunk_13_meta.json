She was the first of a trio of successively larger Hamburg America ships that included SS Vaterland and SS Bismarck built by the line for transatlantic passenger service. At the time of her launch in May 1912, she was the largest passenger ship in the world superseding the RMS Olympic. During World War I, the ship remained in port in Hamburg. After the war she was briefly commissioned into the United States Navy as USS Imperator (ID-4080) and employed for returning American troops from Europe. Following her U.S. Navy service, Imperator was handed over to Britain's Cunard Line as part of war reparations, and she sailed as the flagship RMS Berengaria for the final decade of her career.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Imperator\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Imperator</a>","Other Bain/LOC photos of the IMPERATOR in New York harbor, 1913:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=8623220@N02&amp;q=imperator&amp;m=text\">www.flickr.com/search/?w=8623220@N02&amp;q=imperator&amp;...</a>","Thanks fot the photographys, very interesants.Greetings.","See NYT, August 20, 1913\n  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403E5DB163DE633A25753C2A96E9C946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403E5DB163DE633A...</a>\n\n&quot;BROOKLYN FIELD DAY.; Two Thousand School Children In Various Athletic Exercises.&quot;  The event was on August 19.","swanq: Thanks for the link to the article.

Meadows, Canadian runner.","Roamer was a bay gelding foaled in 1911, bred by the Clay Brothers  in Kentucky. \n\nHe was named Roamer due to the circumstaces of his birth. It was an accidental breeding - somehow, the farm's 'teaser' stallion (a stallion of low value used to test if mares are in heat, who is rarely used for actual breeding), aptly named Knight Errant, got in with a blind mare named Rose Tree II. \n\nAfter being claimed at age two by owner Andrew Miller, Roamer began to blossom. He raced from 1913 to 1919, winning 39 of 98 races.  His best year was 1914, when he won 12 of 16 starts and was the year's leading money earner.  He set five track records and won many notable races, including the Travers Stakes, Carter Handicap, and three Saratoga Cups. Some press accounts called him &quot;The Wonder Horse of the Decade&quot;.\n\nRoamer died in 1920. While being rested on a farm in New Jersey, he slipped in an icy pasture, broke his leg, and had to be destroyed. He was inducted to the Racing Hall of Fame in 1981.\n\nThis photo pre-dates Roamer's fame - in fact, it shows the day his fortunes changed. The jockey here is Thomas McTaggart. The only time he ever rode Roamer was in a claiming race at Belmont Park on July 15, 1913.  They won, &quot;much the best&quot;, by four lengths, and Miller claimed him for $2,000.  He would go on to earn $98,828.","Thanks for making my day !\n\nHave a great weekend my dear friend!","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roamer\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roamer</a>","From wikipedia: \n\nSS Imperator was an ocean liner built for the Hamburg America Line (German: Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft or HAPAG) launched in 1912.

He was considered the finest American orator at a time when keynote speakers at such momentous events as the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery were expected to speak for a couple of hours.  It was Lincoln who jarred the crowd by uttering a few words, then sitting back down before the audience had settled in.  Many who were present thought that Lincoln, in his brevity, showed disrespect to the occasion.  Most journalists covering the event dismissed Lincoln's speech as a sidenote hardly worthy of mention (Lincoln was, after all, a last minute invitee to the event; Everett was the advertised keynote speaker).  Only when Lincoln's speech was reprinted as a circular did the public come to realize the brilliance of his words.  Thus, only in hindsight, do we look back at Lincoln and Everett on that day and dismiss Everett as the &quot;windbag.&quot;  The folks who saw them speak at Gettyburg that day saw it very differently.","True, and most in the crowd who went that day to see the great men were unable to hear the utterances of either of them.","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett_McCall\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett_McCall</a>","Edward Everett McCall (1863-1924), New York Supreme Court Justice.","Thanks Penny.

Del Valle, in summer 1913, a Special Commissioner of the American State Department to Mexico\naccording to  NYT, August 5, 1913\n  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D01E4DF123FE633A25756C0A96E9C946296D6CF&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=&quot;del+valle&quot;&amp;st=p\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D01E4DF123FE633A...</a>","From Google cache of \n  <a href=\"http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/true/body.1_div.11.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">southwest.library.arizona.edu/true/body.1_div.11.html</a>\n\nCHAPTER XI: HON. REGINALD F. DEL VALLE\nTo define a gentleman one might go far afield without disclosing a more pronounced exemplar than is Hon. Reginald F. del Valle, eldest son of Don Ygnacio and Señora del Valle, who of all the human documents yet living is most readily identified as the person Mrs. Jackson had in mind in the idealization of the character of Felipe in the romance. Attire him in Spanish garb, as the artist Henry Sandham has properly done, and the portraits are not wholly unlike.\n\nSenator del Valle left Camulos ranch early in life to prepare himself for the practice of law, a profession he has graced for a quarter of a century in Los Angeles. Without undue self-seeking upon his part he has during that period been honored with many positions of distinction and trust. He always has been a consistent and active member of the Democratic\n\n\n[page 103]\nparty, ever prominent in its councils, and not infrequently called upon to preside over its state conventions. Once he was a candidate for Lieutenant-Governor of California, at another time he served a term with great credit in the State Senate, securing for Los Angeles the State Normal school, and again was a delegate to the national convention of his party. At this time he is serving the City of Los Angeles in the honorary position of a member of the Municipal Water Board, a most important post during the period of bringing the Owens River to the city's gate. It was understood that, in the event of the election of Mr. Bryan, in 1896, Senator del Valle was to have the post of Ambassador to Mexico.\n\nIt is an interesting circumstance, in this connection, that the romance of Mrs. Jackson closes with the arrival and settlement of Felipe and his beautiful bride in the Mexican capital. Of this the author says: ‘‘The story of the romance of their lives, being widely rumored, greatly enhanced the interest with which they were welcomed. The beautiful young Señora Moreno was the theme of the city; and Felipe's bosom thrilled with pride to see the gentle dignity of demeanor by which she was distinguished in all assemblages.’’\n\n\n[page 104]\n\nIn the spring of 1913 affairs throughout the Republic of Mexico were in such chaotic condition, owing to the movements of various revolutionary bodies, that the Administration at Washington felt impelled to withhold recognition of the provisional government represented by General Huerta until reliable assurances could be given of its ability to maintain a stable government and to give adequate protection to the lives and property of all classes of people. That dependable information might be obtained from the various opposing factions in the republic, President Wilson determined to send a personal representative into Mexico, to report such facts as might be developed directly to him, to the end that such action as might finally be taken by the government of the United States should be based upon indisputable facts, gathered by a person wholly disinterested. The mission was a peculiarly delicate one, calling for the highest order of intelligence, of tact and diplomacy. That the distinction should fall upon Hon. Reginald Francisco del Valle, of California, was not calculated to surprise anyone, since his entire fitness for the trust was and is universally recognized. Senator del Valle, his wife and daughter accompanying him, went to Mexico, and at this writing he is in the City of Mexico, performing the duty assigned him by the President of the United States.","Here is a nice biography of him from Who's Who in the Pacific Southwest: a compilation of authentic biographical sketches of citizens of Southern California from 1913:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/richard_arthur_norton/4023197736/]\n\nI also added him to Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_F._Del_Valle\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_F._Del_Valle</a>","Thanks to both of you.

The library has cataloged this photograph from our Biographical File, &quot;BIOG FILE - Valle, Ramon del&quot; using an authority record for &quot;Ramon del Valle-Inclan.

I'd say it is of a different man.  Ramon seems to be known as a bohemian -- which is hardly consistent with this photograph.\n\nThe date suggested by the Bain ordering (Reginald was clearly in the news in the summer of 1913), and the fact that another picture related to US-Mexico relations is next in the series, make me feel that this is Reginald.","I agree with you swanq.

At the end of that season the Giants were tied for first with the hated Dodgers.\nThen in the last playoff game Bobby Thomson hit the homerun that sent them to the worls series.\nI hope you enjoyed my trip down memory lane.","THANK YOU FOR\nSHARING THESE GREAT\nPARTS OF OUR\n&quot;COLLECTIVE HERITAGE&quot;...","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1018543@N24/\">Circa</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Ti ringrazio !!!\n\n*+ +*¨¨*+<b>BEAUTIFUL VINTAGE STYLE! +*¨¨*+ +*\nI have seen and awarded this lovely image in:\n</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/the_way_we_were/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5185/5616283318_dc3814dbd4.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"165\" alt=\"cartolina4\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/the_way_we_were/\">*+*¨¨<u>The way we were - Vintage &amp; retrò P1/C2</u>¨¨*+*</a>\n\nIf you receive 3 or more awards, please post in\nthis <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/the_way_we_were/discuss/72157626506527226/\"><b><u>Gallery</u></b></a> for your special Admin award!","*+ +*¨¨*+<b>BEAUTIFUL VINTAGE STYLE! +*¨¨*+ +*\nI have seen and awarded this lovely image in: \n</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/the_way_we_were/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5185/5616283318_dc3814dbd4.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"165\" alt=\"cartolina4\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/the_way_we_were/\">*+*¨¨<u>The way we were - Vintage &amp; retrò P1/C2</u>¨¨*+*</a>\n\nIf you receive 3 or more awards, please post in \nthis <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/the_way_we_were/discuss/72157626506527226/\"><b><u>Gallery</u></b></a> for your special Admin award!","That kid is freaking me out.","I didn't think fruit could have personal space boundaries until now.","lolz","love this one","Sugar image.

I think that may account for the pipe smoking and gun toting seen in this photo.\n\nThe Ball brothers also put down the cash to start Ball State University in Muncie.  Because their sister had been blackballed by an Ivy League sorority back east, one of their conditions of founding was that there be no national sororities affiliated with the campus, a policy which still stands.","Photography, like anything, is about more than one thing.

Ward retired from baseball at age 34 in order to enter the legal profession. As a successful lawyer he represented baseball players against the National League. Later he acted as president and part-owner of the Boston Braves franchise and became an official in the short lived Federal League in 1914, acting a the business manager of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops.[3]","I just wanted to clarify that according to Wikipedia, the department store we knew as Montgomery Wards was started in 1872 by Aaron Montgomery Ward, not John Montgomery Ward.

Whitt was the Yankees' opening day CF that season but lost his job when talented Earle Combes was acquired after the season started.  After a torrid .400 BA start, Combes broke his ankle in June and Whitt was reinstated as the CF'er for the rest of the season.\n\nWhitey Whitt's real name was Ladislaw Waldemar Wittkowski.  Unlike most players of his day, Whitt was a college boy, having attended Bowdoin College.  He was also no stranger to the perils of playing the outfield.  Two seasons before the Babe's felling in Washington, Whitt himself was put down by a bottle thrown by a Browns' fan the day the Yankees clinched the 1922 pennant  in St. Louis.\n\nAfter initially offering a one thousand dollar reward for the fingering of the perpetrator, American League president Ban Johnson abruptly changed course when St. Louis fans threatened a riot.  Johnson announced that Whitt had stepped on the bottle while running in CF and that the bottle had flipped up, striking him in the head and knocking him out!","source?","Following up on robinsegg's comment about the African-American spectators, the right field pavilion at segregated Griffith Stadium in D.C. was the only place African-American fans could sit.\n\nMore on this incident with Babe Ruth, including a short film, at \n<a href=\"http://www.nationalspride.com/columnists/post.cfm?blog=mark&amp;id=217&amp;story=the-babe-in-dc\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nationalspride.com/columnists/post.cfm?blog=mark&amp;...</a>","Ruth is the man...\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kingkongphoto/3498011542/\">www.flickr.com/photos/kingkongphoto/3498011542/</a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1037228@N20/\">just cool pictures</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/591987@N24/\">soulful group</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/972473@N24/\">piece of heaven</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/936496@N24/\">THE BEST PHOTOS OF THE WORLD</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","very nice","I am sure this is now an upscale subdivision","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/21686909@N07]  Hahaha","Slide, Kelly, Slide\n\nI like the bottle bat, the high shoes, and the belt.

It clearly states in your description that Stengel played for the Brooklyn Dodgers.","Casey Stengel played for the Brooklyn Ball Club from 1912 to 1917.  The Club was called the Dodgers in only one year he played there, 1912. The next year(1913) they were named the Superbas. \nFrom 1914 to 1931 they were nicknamed the Robins.

Of course, we are from Brooklyn and that's why.\n\nNever to be forgotten!","The Perfessor was a hero in Brooklyn long before you were ever born.  He last PLAYED in Brooklyn in 1917 and last managed Brooklyn in 1936.  After that, he was no longer a hero in Brooklyn unless your family were somehow Yankee fans.","I am a lifelong Yankees fan starting from the mid 1950s.  My dad who had been an intensely loyal Dodgers fan, and was as mad as heck when they moved to LA, switched his loyalties to the Mets when they came along in the early 60s.  \n\nThus, Casey remained a hero to a great many Yankees &amp; Mets fans both for his on field accomplishments and for his witty manners.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/29493863@N06]  Okay, I see your situation, but the way you stated it before &quot;we are from Brooklyn and that's why&quot; is odd because that really would not be the usual case for liking Stengel.  It would usually be the case for hating him.\n\nI find Casey to be an interesting character in the history of the game, but in truth, he was not a very good manager by the time he took over the Yankees.  His lifetime winning record was just .508.  Frankly, anyone who could fill in a line up card could have won in those 12 seasons Casey had the Yanks.  He looked like a genius when he chose Larsen to pitch in 1956 and throw a perfect game, but there is no question in my mind that Casey lost the 1960 World Series by not going with Ford as his game one pitcher which would have allowed Ford to pitch 3 games.  That huge mistake more than anything caused Casey to be let go.  \n\nOf course, it was also, as Casey said:  &quot;I made the mistake of turning 70&quot;.  Once he got a team of unprotected players (the Mets), it was a case of setting a record for most losses in a season.  The manager snoozed on the bench in the late innings, the result of age and alcoholism (not much is ever mentioned about that, but Casey drank every night for many, many years).  And one of the Yankees whom I knew (I won't mention his name because one day I am going to write a story about him) told me &quot;I saw the Old Man a number of times sleeping on the bench&quot; during the Yankee years.  \n\nSo, looking back on it, the Yankees had the horses and Casey just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  He most certainly had hunches about situations and players, like the selection of Larsen, but, again, not starting Ford in game one, 1960 WS was just plain boneheaded.  \n\nThe Yankees were special despite the hijinks of Ford, Mantle, and Billy Martin.  Just imagine how great Mantle would have been had he not gone out drinking and carousing nearly every night with Whitey and often with Billy.  Mantle said so himself many times in his retirement and especially after his liver was shot.  Think about it, he was faster than Willie Mays getting down to first base....he was the fastest in baseball....when he batted left handed, he could run to first in 3.1 seconds.  Let me tell you, that is moving.  But, then he got hobbled up after tearing his knee up on that sprinkler head in Yankee Stadium.  Oh, there was all that baloney about him having osteo arthritis from a high school football injury.  I don't buy that because in 1953, Mantle could run with the best of them.  How many games did he play with a hangover?  Many.  Seriously, had he taken care of himself like Willie Mays did, Mantle would have hit more lifetime homeruns than Mays, but Mays was able to play 24 seasons.  Not taking anything away from Willie because like Leo Durocher always said &quot;Willie was some kind of ballplayer.  He was the best I ever saw.&quot;  And Leo saw a lot of ball players.  So, no, I don't think Casey was that good of a manager.  And in his later years he had trouble with getting along with the young players.  The Yankees had another reason they would have won with Casey sleeping on the bench and despite his bonehead moves.  They had Yogi.  I say Yogi was responsible for many of those Yankee wins during the years he caught.  Yogi called the games.\n\nWell, I will end here.  Casey was a character and I think much of his thinking and his speech was clouded by alcohol and then later, old age.  Let's face it, a 70 year old guy is not at the top of his game, especially if he nods off during the game.  Funny?  Yes, Stengel was as funny as Yogi, maybe even funnier at times.  Did his diatribes make sense?  Not often.  He talked in circles.","I dont pretend to know any Yankee ball players. \nMost of the games of the 1960's i listened to on a radio.\nIt seems to be the opinion of some baseball buffs that Stengle protected ford.\nHowever the fact remains Ford pitched more innings than any other Yankee in that decade.\nMel Stottlemyer was next.\nRaloh Terry was in there somewhere.\nAll in all the yankees had a strong staff.\nif the yankees did'nt have it they bought it.\nWonder who decided who was to stay a Yankee,and who was to go?","Stengel wasn't protecting Ford.  He wanted to pitch him against the best pitchers in the league.  You have to look at each season.  Ford never won 20 games UNTIL Stengel was GONE.  He got to pitch a lot more under Houk.  Casey was just weird about when Ford was going to pitch.  This is what I mean by Casey not being such a great manager at times.  I think Stengel was a lot sharper as a manager when he first went to the Yankees in 1949.  He won a lot of one run games then.  But, later on, as he grew old, he lost his touch, in my opinion.  I will give him credit, however, for his platooning of players which extended their careers and made sense in other ways.  He also stuck with guys who maybe others would not have at first.....a lot of people didn't think much of Berra at first.  Yogi was not a good defensive catcher until Stengel got Bill Dickey to help him along.  Now imagine if Stengel had decided to not play Berra?  One of the greatest ballplayers of all time and, I might add, one of the greatest guys the game has ever known.  Also, Bobby Brown and Bill Skowron were not so good when they first came up, but Stengel saw their potential and he was right.  He did see potential in players. \nYes, the Yankees were a strong team because they could afford to spend money.  George Weiss was the GM during that time the Yankees won the 10 pennants in 12 years and he made the decision on who to trade.  Not sure how much Casey had a say in trades, maybe not much at all.  Interesting that Weiss was let go the same time as Casey.  Weiss and Casey both went to the Mets.","&quot;Can't anybody play this game?!?!&quot;","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/50245058@N03] At one time there were 16 major league teams. With 25 men on each squad that ment that 400 of the best baseball players in the world were taking the field .\nYes, they could play this game.\nIt might be a little watered down now with expansion,however it's still baseball.\nWhen Bill Terry,and Ted Williams hit 400 plus they did it against some of the games greatest pitchers. \nBudderflyman can tell you.\nit was and is Americas game~!","Memoriesaremadeofthis, I was referring to Casey's famous quote about the New York Mets, when he was their manager during their first year of play.  Casey had many more famous quotes that I love.  He had a unique way with the English language!","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cherriesmixednuts]  Yes, Williams and Terry hit .400, but if you look at the MLB batting avg, especially in 1930 when Terry did it, it was overall higher.  The difference is relief pitching and the rotation of five starters.  This makes it harder for batters who used to get to the starter in the late innings.  In Terry's day, there were still teams using a rotation of three pitchers, with an occasional insertion of a fourth.  When Williams hit .406 in 1941 (the last time a major leaguer has hit .400), there were no five man rotations.  Pitchers are also much better trained now in mechanics and conditioning and managers/pitching coaches carefully watch pitch counts.  No one watched pitch counts in 1941.  When you were a starter back then, you were expected to finish.  That actually was true until the early to mid seventies.  I can remember when Fergie Jenkins, one of my favorite pitchers, had 30 complete games in 1971.  Now, how many pitchers have 30 CG's in a career?   Batters definitely suffered when starters got routinely yanked by the seventh inning.  On the other hand, there has been no one with a batting eye any better than Ted Williams.  \n\nBatters looked for ways to get an edge.  Longer, thinner handled bats that they could whip, for example.  That's legal.  But then, corked bats or bats with little super balls inside.  That's illegal.  Batters began to condition themselves better, lifting weights and using other exercise equipment.  Andre Dawson was really one of the first major stars to go heavily into weight lifting and what a six pack set of abs that guy had.  When I played in high school and college, the coaches wouldn't let us near any weights.  We were forbidden to lift weights or to go swimming because it would make us muscle bound.  Ha, now look at these players.  They all are bulked up.  And what better way to bulk up than to take performance enhancing nutrional supplements and steroids.  Then the pitchers saw what steroids did for skinny singles hitting guys like Palmeiro (that's right...look at his stats and weight with the Cubs), so some pitchers like Roger Clemens started taking steroids.  And there you have it.\n\nI was actually trying to get to this point:  certainly expansion will always water down any sport,  however fewer really good athletes go into baseball, percentage wise, than they did in 1941.  Baseball didn't pay very much in 1941, but a good athlete could make a lot more in baseball than in pro football or pro basketball back then, and baseball was truly the American past time.  Kids everywhere played baseball.  Today, if you are a great athlete, you might not want to work toward playing baseball professionally.  The fact is, if you are Black, you are far more likely to work toward the NBA  if you have the size.  Why is this?  A couple of reasons.  One reason there are so many Black basketball stars is that playgrounds have basketball courts, not necessarily baseball  or football fields because those take up too much room.  You just need a basketball and one hoop.  The second thing is television.  Today you can watch college and NBA all season long.  Not so when I was a kid.  I lived in the Chicago area and we saw &quot;The Big Ten game of the week&quot; and an NBA game maybe on Saturday and Sunday.  (Soon came the Chicago Zephyrs).  Football &quot;College game of the week&quot; and &quot;Big Ten game of the week&quot;.  That was it.  Third, look at colleges......not  many fans typically go to college baseball games and this has always been the case, so that when a great athlete goes to a good college, he may decide to choose basketball or football over baseball.  Some guys will play all three, but that is really rare today.  Years ago, Bob Griese played all three at Purdue.  Or guys like Dave Winfield at Minnesota.  But, today?  Maybe two sports.  But, something happened.....The NFL and the NBA started paying competitive salaries eventually.   And that, more than anything, watered down baseball.  Baseball just was not as exciting to some kids as football and basketball.  \n\nAnd, of course, when Williams hit .406, there were no Blacks in baseball.  So, as Blacks entered the game in large numbers in the fifties, it really was time to expand to make room for them.  However, eventually, as I said, things did get watered down when larger salaries attracted good athletes to football and basketball.  So, it expanded and then watered down.  Now, there are fewer Black players per team than there were in the 1960s.  \n\nI probably should take more time to write this a little more coherently, but I just wanted you to realize it wasn't all due to expansion in MLB.  And I didn't even discuss artificial turf, domed stadiums, and another HUGE factor in declining hitting which was NIGHT GAMES (although today's lighting is so much better than it was when I played).  I need to write a book on this.\n\nAnd, yes, baseball IS America's game.....except that it was invented in England!!!  Now, don't let those people in Cooperstown see this.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/50245058@N03] \nAll right everyone, line up alphabetically according to your height.\nThat was Casey.\nI stand corrected. \nI should have recognized Stengle when i saw it.\nThanks for your input. this is fun~!!","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/21686909@N07] The late Darrell Royal said that opinions are like ass holes,everybody has one..\nThe thing is i seem to agree with what you have to say.\nI think the ball might have been a little juiced in 1930. I mean George Watkins hit 373 ~!\nGo ahead Butter, write somemore ,i like it.\nLet me see who you think was the best catcher?\nMicky Cochrane, Gabby Hartnett, Ernie Lombardi,Bill Dicky,or Roger Bresnahan?\nor do you like one of the modern catchers?","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cherriesmixednuts]  I also think the ball was juiced a bit in 1930 and that something was done to make it less lively after that.  All sorts of records were set in 1930, especially in the American League.  \n\nThe problem is that I never saw any of those catchers you mentioned, so I can only go by what I have read over the years and what I have heard baseball people say.   So, I would pick Cochrane, then close behind would be Hartnett and Dickey.  The only clip I ever saw of Lombardi was when he snoozed.  And when you snooze, you lose.  Bresnahan was a bit earlier yet and it's hard to compare him with the others for that reason, but certainly he was the best of his era.  I saw Yogi and Campanella play....and it is really hard to choose between those two, but my guess is that either of them was better than any of those you listed.  And then came Johnny Bench.  He and I are the same age and I saw him play many times in person.  He really was a cut above any other catcher of his era including Fisk and Carter.  I was amazed at how fast Bench could run in his early years, and, of course, impressed by his arm and his huge hands and his power.  \n\nAfter Bench, we have seen several fine catchers, some very good hitters.  Pudge Rodriguez was certainly a great one, and I always thought if the Cubs could had got him instead of him going to Florida, well, the Cubs would have won their first World Series in a hundred years.  I have no doubt about that.  And of course Mike Piazza.  How could you not have Piazza in the list of greatest catchers of all time?","Sweet shades bro!","Note the &quot;bottle&quot; bat.","Taken at the Polo Grounds, New York.","Wikipedia link:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Sallee\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Sallee</a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/338125@N24/\"> AMERICA, AMERICA!  ~GARDEN PARTY &amp; VACATION MEMORIES open~</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\nExcellent!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/74453470@N00/\">Eye Candy Art  Post  (share 1 comment 1)</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","from Wikipedia (re American League teams):\n&quot;The Milwaukee Brewers, as they were originally known, moved to St. Louis in 1902 and became the <b>St. Louis Browns</b>.

Sulzer was served with a summons to appear before the Court for the Trial of Impeachments, and Lieutenant Governor Martin H. Glynn was empowered to act in his place pending the outcome of the trial. However, Sulzer maintained that the proceedings against him were unconstitutional and refused to vacate his office.[2] Both Sulzer and Glynn claimed to be Governor. Lt.Gov. Glynn began signing documents as &quot;Acting Governor&quot; beginning on August 21.[3]\n\nThe trial of Governor William Sulzer before the Impeachment Court began in in Albany on September 18. The court convicted Sulzer on three of the Articles of Impeachment on the afternoon of October 16, finding him guilty of filing a false report with the Secretary of State concerning his campaign contributions, committing perjury, and advising another person to commit perjury before an Assembly committee[4]. The following day, the court voted on a resolution to remove Sulzer from office. On October 17, 1913, Sulzer was removed by the same margin, a vote of 43-12, and Lt. Gov. Glynn succeeded to the governorship.[5]&quot;\n\nThe date on the negative suggests that this is the vote in the NY legislature to impeach rather than the impeachment trial.","swanq:  Thanks for noticing the date on the neg. and for the additional information here!","The American Express Co. delivery van could be an electric vehicle.

When he began to protest, volubly, the gendarmes cautioned him: &quot;Don't make waves!&quot; So he sits now, stymied and disgusted, with his rolled-up rental sign in his lap -- thinking black thoughts, and hoping that a tired soul will notice him, and approach with an offer for the chair. \n\nAt this point, the would-be entrepreneur may be willing simply to sell the chair outright, or even abandon it, and head back to Brugge in defeat.\n\nBut before he does that, it's likely that he will wander along the beach for an hour or so, looking for dropped centimes and francs to help finance his purchase of a return ticket on the chemin de fer . . . .","LOC -- Google maps says there is no &quot;h&quot; in Blankenberge.","Everyone, \n\nThanks for your comments! The caption of 'Blankenberghe, baigneurs' comes directly from the photochrom itself, and the English title is copied directly from the printed catalog produced by the Detroit Publishing Company. Sometimes these titles are not exact translations, as is the case here.  The French title does in fact mean 'Bathers' and the title given in the catalog is 'The Beach'.  At the time of this photograph, Blankenberghe was sometimes spelled in this manner, but the modern spelling seems to be Blankenberge, so we can add that spelling to the record as well.","Wystan- lovely conjurings, I'd read a book of yours if you wrote one. :)","So brilliant...","Really like that kid in the foreground walking on water.","<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/64369562@N07/\">www.flickr.com/people/64369562@N07/</a> has suggested geotags for this image - <a href=\"http://www.whatsthatpicture.com/flickr/commons/owner.php?nsid=8623220@N02&amp;action=geo\" rel=\"nofollow\">view the suggestion on the Commons Tagr app</a>.

John van Artevelde was a city sheriff in the beginning of the 14th century (John = Jan = Jean).  John may or may not have been a relative of Jacob, some sources claim that Jacob is Johns' son.  But the origins of Jacob remain very unclear.\nJacob played an important role in negotiations between Flanders and England about wool trade, and hence made him an enemy of France.\nHe was murdered on 24th July 1345, for until now unknown reasons.\nThe statue was erected in 1863.\n\nThe building at the right hand side in the picture, het Toreken, was the guild house of the tanners, now housing a poetry centre.\n\nSaint Jacobs church is behind the houses in the background, and has no link with Jacob Van Artevelde.","<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&amp;q=50.645345,5.573578&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=50.645106,5.574281&amp;panoid=eTZIncApM3Ss8rkrbqq1kA&amp;cbp=13,305.83,,0,-12.69&amp;ll=50.637173,5.578737&amp;spn=0.017093,0.048237&amp;z=14&amp;source=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Streetview</a>","This bridge was destroyed in 1914.

They were used most prominently on American dreadnought battleships and armored cruisers of the World War I era. Their purpose was to make the observation posts mounted on the masts and used to direct the fire of the warships' guns less vulnerable to shells from enemy ships.\n\nThese masts remind me of Chinese finger traps.","More lattice masts in this image:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2658042577/]\n\nMust have been some fun painting these things!","Battleship USS Alabama (BB-08).  Used for an extensive period as a training vessel for Naval Militias:\n\n&quot; Alabama was placed in reserve at New York on 3 November 1908. Though she remained inactive at New York, the battleship was not decommissioned until 17 August 1909. The warship underwent an extensive overhaul that lasted until the early part of 1 912. On 17 April 1912, she was placed in commission, second reserve, at New York, Comdr. Charles F. Preston in command. At that point, she became an element of the newly established Atlantic Reserve Fleet. According to that concept, the Navy organize d a unit that comprised nine of the older battleships as well as Brooklyn (Armored Cruiser No. 3), Columbia (Cruiser No. 12), and Minneapolis (Cruiser No. 13) for the purpose of keeping those ships constantly read for active servi ce using the fiscal expedient of severely reduced complements that could be filled out rapidly by naval militiamen and volunteers in an emergency. The unit as a whole possessed enough officers and men to take two or three of the ships to sea on a rota ting basis to test their material readiness and to exercise the sailors at drill. \n\nAlabama was placed in full commission on 25 July 1912 and operated with the Atlantic Fleet off the New England coast through the summer. She was returned to reserve status-in commission, first reserve-at New York on 10 September 1912. Late in t he spring of 1913, the Navy added a new dimension to the concept of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet by having the warships of that unit embark detachments of the various state naval militias for training afloat in a manner similar in many respects to the c ontemporary Navy's selected reserve program. During the summer of 1913, Alabama cruised along the east coast and made two round-trip voyages to Bermuda to train naval militiamen from Maryland, the District of Columbia, New York, Rhode Island, M aine, North Carolina, and Indiana. She ended her last training cruise of the year at Philadelphia on 2 September. The battleship was placed in ordinary on 31 October 1913 and in reserve on 1 July 1914&quot;\n\nref.

Other Ottoman provinces in North Africa were lost between 1830 and 1912, starting from Algeria (occupied by France in 1830), Tunisia (occupied by France in 1881) and Libya (occupied by Italy in 1912.)\n\nThe Armenians, who were granted their own constitution and national assembly with the Tanzimat reforms, began pressing the Ottoman government for greater autonomy after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 and the Congress of Berlin in 1878. A number of Armenian uprisings took place in the cities of Anatolia, and Armenian militants seized the Ottoman Bank headquarters in Constantinople.Sultan Abdul Hamid II responded to these uprisings and attacks by establishing the Hamidiye regiments in eastern Anatolia, formed mostly of irregular cavalry units of recruited Kurds.

Not unlike current times, investors flocked to the project and plunked down their hard earned dollars with visions of a fortune in their future. There was a ceremony for laying the cornerstone on May 26, 1906 with the usual pomp and circumstance. By the end of the year, the foundations were still not laid and investors began to get nervous. So on February 17, 1907 another ceremony was held and the first piece of steel was installed. Promises were made to be 50% complete by May 15th and 100% complete by the end of 1908.

The question will soon be settled in the courts, for Murphy &amp; Krug, who conduct an eating place on the boardwalk, have started a civil suit against Mayor Reginald S. Bennett for preventing the open sale of their speciality on the first day of the week.\n\nKrug &amp; Murphy say that some weeks ago they found there was a demand on the part of promenaders and bathers for frankfurter sausages on rolls, such as one sees at Coney Island. The caterers at once placed a big supply on exhibition, surmounted by a sign calling attention to the digestibility of their offerings.\n\nWhen Mayor Bennett heard about it, it is said that he called an emergency meeting of his cabinet, at which it was decided that such sales on Sundays would not add to the dignity of the beach. Murphy &amp; Krug received information to that effect.\n\nPermission, however, was given to continue the sale of the sausages in the rear of the restraunt on Sundays. Murphy &amp; Krug defied the Mayor, and yesterday morning the frankfurters publicly were offered for sale. A rush of customers was quickly followed by a rush of police, and for the rest of the day a policeman stood on fixed post in front of the restraunt by order of the Mayor, turning customers away. The law suit is the consequence, the plaintiffs saying that Mayor Bennett has neither legal nor a moral right to interfere.","The photographer was standing in Asbury Park, but the photo is actually of the North End Hotel and Pavilion in neighboring Ocean Grove.

So maybe that's Hicks?\n\nThis would have been the maiden voyage of the Imperator, which left Cuxhaven on June 20 with stops at Cherbourg and Southampton, where Sullivan presumably boarded. At the time she was the largest passenger liner in service, and cruised at 23 knots. This would have been the height of trans-Atlantic luxury at the time. She was equipped with a swimming pool, and so much marble in the upper deck cabins that she was top heavy and suffered from stability problems.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Imperator\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Imperator</a>","Seems like a weird photo","article on the process of photochrom:\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochrom\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochrom</a>\n\n&quot;Photochrom[Note 1] (also called the Aäc process) prints are colorized images produced from black and white photographic negatives via the direct photographic transfer of a negative onto lithographic printing plates.&quot;","Great shot, good work","Wow, if I had this, I would straighten that horizon and then make a large print of it.

Also she was only stationed in the Mersey until 1941, being moved to the Menai Straights to avoid the blitz.\n\nThe ship in the photo looks like she's the same class as the <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/displays/conway/history.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">second HMS Conway</a>, originally HMS Winchester, a 51 gun frigate, but she swapped the name with HMS  Nile in 1876.  There's a nice photo of <a href=\"http://www.brucehunt.co.uk/Mount Edgcumbe big.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">her at Saltash</a> in her final incarnation as the reform ship Mount Edgcumbe.\n\nSo my guess is that she's a Royal Navy frigate, but we're unlikely to ever know the name. :-(","Of course no sooner do I write that than I find by a <a href=\"http://images.google.com.au/images?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;um=1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=frigate+bangor&amp;btnG=Search+images&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google image search</a> that the ship was the former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Clio_(1858)\" rel=\"nofollow\">HMS Clio</a>, built in 1858 as a 22 gun corvette and lent by the navy as the <a href=\"http://www.prosiectmenai.co.uk/hmsclio.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Industrial Training Ship Clio</a>.  She was stationed in the Menai Straights from 1877 (moved there from the River Dee) until she was scrapped in 1920.  There's a <a href=\"http://www.llandegfan.anglesey.sch.uk/images/clio3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">nice photo of her at anchor</a> at the bottom of the Ysgol Llandegfan page on <a href=\"http://www.llandegfan.anglesey.sch.uk/village.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Llandegfan village</a> (ysgol is Welsh for school).\n\nSo, this photo must be sometime between 1877 and 1920.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/94482242@N00/] a bit late to tell you now.

Can you clarify please.\n\nThe scene above takes in one of my favourite bike ride routes when I was still living in the UK (I'm local born from nearby Ynys Môn), there are more trees nowadays but it is remarkibly similar outlook.\n\nCan I also ask Vagabond Jewelry why she posted the link to the photochrom wiki on all these images (just curious)?","The photochrom wiki explains the colours that you're asking about - these were taken with black and white film and the photochrom process is, more or less, a way to automate hand colouring. Hence the very vivid colors","OK, Thanks for explaining. So you are saying these postcards are photographic prints with multiple litho spot-colour tints applied afterwards? It must have been murder inking, hefting, registeringa and printing multiple stones, probably hundreds, possibly thousands of times for each run of images (I mean - lots were printed to make money no?...) \n\nWhat I can't understand is how the images are so vivid after nearly 120 years. They must have been stored in an light/air-tight environment for the last 90 years to look so good, either that, or they have been tweaked for saturation after scanning.\n\nIt's great that these prints are being digitised, though it's odd to see the Library of Congeress doing it when the images are of a little country which is part of a small island on the other side of the Atlantic (speaking as a Welshman...).","Based on the time they were printed, one would assume oil based inks- which will keep their colour for a very very long time- just as long as oil based paints, in fact. Turner's paintings surely have not faded. \n\nI agree- it is amazing the variety of images the Library of Congress has! I think that, more or less, they keep everything they are given, and the link they provided gives some insight on where this particular trove came from.

Access to the hotel is via a long, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/16248284@N03/5977298762/\">narrow drive</a>. Berwyn Station with its famous <a href=\"http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/page.php?id=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">steam trains</a> is located across the river from the hotel.\n\nThe chain bridge, from which the hotel takes its name, was originally constructed in 1814 by Exuperious Pickering, a local owner of coal mines and lime kilns, to enable him to take his coal across the river for delivery to Corwen and Bala while avoiding three toll fees over the Llangollen Town Bridge. \n\nThe original bridge hung from a network of handmade chains, and became the most famous and unique bridge on the river. It was refurbished and strengthened in 1870, rebuilt in 1876, and rebuilt again in 1929. \n\nThe bridge has been closed due to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanfrombangor/5081635163/\">safety reasons</a> for the past 30 years, however a recent grant from the <a href=\"http://www.hlf.org.uk/aboutus/decisionmakers/committees/Documents/WalScheduleMarch.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> will allow a thorough evaluation of the bridge, and determine the cost to restore it (if further funding is available).\n\nThe original <b>Chain Bridge Inn</b> was most likely built around the same time as the bridge (c.1814). In the 1870s the Inn was rebuilt and enlarged in the black and white style that can be seen today.\n\nThe Tudor Bar is situated in the main, 1870, building, and has black and white beams, with an Inglenook fireplace.\n\nWilliam Watson (1873-1961), the Liverpool-born champion cylist, racing driver and motoring pioneer, was also interested in hotels, and briefly owned the Chain Bridge Hotel around 1960.\n\nSeamus O'Keeffe and his wife Elizabeth, bought the hotel in 2012 for £500,000, and have pledged to fully restore the hotel by the Bicentennial of the hotel in 2014.\n<i>&mdash;Compiled</i> [<a href=\"http://www.chainbridgehotel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> [<a href=\"http://llanblogger.blogspot.com/2012/10/new-owners-vision-for-chainbridge-hotel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.rhyljournal.co.uk/news/113295/-500-000-price-tag-as-ex-stephanie-hotel-sold.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-east-wales-18190768\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>] [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Watson_(motoring_pioneer)#cite_ref-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.peoplescollectionwales.co.uk/(X(1)A(V5sf9LG0zAEkAAAAMTgyMTUyNjUtMDdiYS00MGI2LThmY2EtMjBlN2MwODdlNzZlqLwdep07mXTrBwHb98cz4strAis1))/Item/45816-the-chain-bridge-and-hotel\" rel=\"nofollow\">6</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.llangollen.org.uk/history/the-chain-bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">7</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.pentredwr.co.uk/lcc/newslet/nov07.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">8</a>] [<a href=\"http://online-bookings.touristnetuk.com/hotel/gb/chainbridgehotel.html?aid=311272\" rel=\"nofollow\">9</a>]\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>Chain Bridge Hotel &ndash; Then and Now</b> (100+ years later)\n\nAt some point a major three-story addition was made, significantly increasing the length of the hotel along the river-front.

Prince Yusuf lived in obscurity from the time of his father's death in 1876 until the dethronement of his cousin, Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1909. Under the Turkish constitution, Yusuf, the oldest Ottoman prince, became heir to his cousin, Mehmed V. Considered a modernizer and reformer, he apparently committed suicide on 1 February 1916. It was suspected at the time that he might have been murdered at the connivance of the powerful minister of war, Enver Pasha, with whom he had clashed.\n\n\nMehmed VI Wahid ed-din (Ottoman Turkish: محمد سادس Meḥmed-i sâdis, Turkish: Mehmed Vahideddin or Mehmet Vahdettin) (14 January/2 February 1861  – 15/16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide ? of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on July 4, 1918, as the thirty-sixth padishah.

He was also addicted to speed, and several times raced in private trains across the continent to set speed records for long distance travel. One such exploit took place in July, 1913 -- a fast trip from his home in Minneapolis to New York City, where he had a seat on the Stock Exchange. &quot;The most sensational of all the stories in which Charles G. Gates has figured,&quot; said the New York Times in its obituary, &quot;was a report from Minneapolis last July that he had been thrashed in a restaurant by Frank Hopwood, his father-in-law.&quot; That report pursued Gates to New York, where on his arrival he denied the story, and said that he would return to Minneapolis and thrash the person who launched the rumor, if he could identify him.

John McGraw asked that the pitchers and catchers report first to spring training, weeks ahead of other players, as they always seem to be the most ‘out-of-shape.’ and when once asked about a substitute hitter in a game, he described the man as “good in the pinch,” leading to use of the term ‘pinch-hitter.’ His New York Giants teams won 10 National League pennants, 3 World Series, and finished second 11 times. His record for most wins as a National League manager still stands at 2,669 victories. He was an incredible judge of baseball talent, and his player development program made the Giants perennial contenders.

Mrs. Thompson's hand is sharp, as is her shirt collar, and the elbow of the boy on the right.\nWhen you consider Lange was hand-holding a large format camera fifteen feet away in a muddy field, I think she did bloody well to get <i>anything</i> in focus!","Actually, there is no boy in the picture :)\n\nHaving spent an hour plus cleaning this picture, I can say with some authority that the area most in focus is her cleavage... (well, actually the checkered shirt she's wearing). That's something you'll notice if you print the picture at about 25x20&quot; (at 300ppi), or about five times as big as the original.","well the child's hair (on the right) is on the same plane as the shirt, correct? and wouldn't that make the face of the woman in front of the focal plane? and yes, arturo, i didn't take that into account. that is quite impressive.\n\nregardless, my point was that the woman's face is not quite in focus. I'm wondering if it was deliberate or not.\n\ngreat photo nonetheless","Possibly, it's just easier to locate the focal plane based on patterns like the checkers on the shirt or the knitting of the cardigan than hair... \n\nAs Arturo said, with the technical limitations of the day and the context of the shoot (Florence Owen was less a willing participant than a passive subject, and Lange likely didn't want to overstay her welcome) it's unlikely that the focus was deliberately off.","got it. thanks","Que triste la foto!","Amazing photo...I'm sure today there are many faces just like this....I do remember hearing a story from one of the children that they hid their faces because they were embarrassed...very sad.","Love it\namazing moment \nSo much emotions in such a simple frame","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/52149095@N00/] The one girl that didn't want her picture taken was the eldest daughter that can be seen in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/trialsanderrors/3384273233\"> first photo</a> of the series &ndash; she's not in this picture.

She said of her approach to her work &quot;What I photograph, I do not molest or tamper with or arrange. I try to make a picture as part of its surroundings, as having roots&quot;.\nThe children may have &quot;posed&quot; themselves as Lange took the five photos, getting nearer to Mrs Thompson each time. History doesn't record any actual dialogue between Lange or her subjects. She took the photos, and then drove away.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/artysmokes/]\n<i>If this is a scan of the negative, then it's the negative of a copy of the original, with the thumb burned out. What happened to the original negative?</i>\n\nThe thumb was burned out of the negative some time after the original prints were made, so this is a scan of the negative as it appears now. A print of the original version was discovered only recently and is part of the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1998021539/PP\" rel=\"nofollow\">LoC collection</a>.\n\n<i>History doesn't record any actual dialogue between Lange or her subjects.</i>\n\nActually, Florence Owen's children <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/12/02/dustbowl.photo/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">claim</a> that Lange promised her mom that the pictures would not be published (a pretty implausible claim, given Lange's job description).\n\n<i>What is your source for that statement? I don't believe Lange asked them to pose, if that's what you are implying.</i>\n\nI'll have to get back to you on the source (there are dozens discussing the picture and the belated response of the family), but her statement can hardly be taken at face value. Lange took some 4000 pictures for the RA/FSA  alone, and quite a few show clear signs of interaction with her subjects. Lange had a reputation of being able to make herself nearly invisible if she wanted to, but clearly the Owens family noticed and responded to her. By the time Lange took the &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; picture, she was close enough so that the girls could simply stay out of the picture if they didn't want to appear in it (as some of them they did on the earlier shots). For them to get back into the picture and then to turn their heads is not a plausible scenario if the agreed-upon sequence is indeed the correct one.","<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/buddyicons/76204898@N00.jpg?1225680369#76204898@N00\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" /> <b>…trialsanderrors</b> wrote &quot;The thumb was burned out of the negative some time after the original prints were made.&quot;\n\nJust a technique question, but how does one do that?

What fun! \n\nI love Delano's WWII-era work....and he even dabbled in expensive early Kodacolor.","In about 1980, the Library of Congress gift shop sold prints of this photograph (and several others) as a limited edition (they are long out of print!).  I was working at the American Folklife Center at the Library at the time, and I wrote back-of-the-print notes for about a half dozen of the selected photographs.  In the course of doing this (as best I recall), I ran into Jack Delano (the photographer for this image) and followed up with an exchange of letters.  He confirmed the yarn that we had all heard about the photo: &quot;You told the man his pants were falling down.&quot;  Here is the note I wrote that accompanied the print-for-sale in the 1980s:\n\nThis photograph is part of a group of pictures made in Connecticut between 1937 and 1941 by Farm Security Administration photographers Jack Delano, John Collier, Russell Lee, Edwin Locke, and Marion Post Wolcott.  Evidently the agency had offered some agricultural support programs in the region.  The photographers' captions suggest that they were sent to portray three overlapping groups: part-time farmers, ethnic farmers, and tobacco farmers.  The caption for this photograph, made in a community north of Hartford, reads &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Lyman, Polish tobacco farmer and FSA client.&quot; \n\nThe picture shows a high degree of camera consciousness on the part of the subjects, and can be seen as a collaboration between photographer Jack Delano and the Lymans.  The Lymans seem to have assumed the customary pose for a snapshot: standing side by side and facing the camera.  Delano, however, does not shoot them head on, but shoots from a low angle to one side.  And unlike a snapshot's eye contact and smile, this picture has been made at a moment of high laughter and diverted gaze.  Delano explains that he made the couple laugh by telling Mr. Lyman that his pants were falling down.  &quot;The thought of such a catastrophe,&quot; Delano writes, &quot;apparently made them break up.&quot; \n\nJack Delano studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and subsequently became interested in photography.  He worked for the FSA and the Office of War Information until 1943, finishing his stint with an assignment to Puerto Rico.  He fell in love with the island, returning first on a Guggenheim photographic fellowship and later serving as director of Puerto Rico's radio and television operation.","What a wonderful story.

It was the side that the workers lived on as you can see by the row homes in the picture.  As the plant closed and the jobs disappeared many families were forced to leave.  Shops and lunch counters closed with no noon rush to keep them open.  The south side became run down, buildings sat empty and this cemetery was neglected and vandalized.  \n\nBehind where Evans stood to shoot this image, the graves continue up into the tree line.  Many do not contain a word of English, baring testament to the various ethnic groups that had come here to work at the steel.  Some, such as a plain cross cut from sheet metal show just how hard some people were struggling.","I have always been intrigued and saddened by the downfall of Bethlehem Steel and all it symbolized in this great nation.  When my horse was stabled at Penn National in 2009 I stopped early one morning (enroute from central NJ) as the sun was rising to video the blast furnaces and empty buildings.

Into your bathing machine at once!","A cropped version of this photo ran in The Sunday Oregonian, July 13, 1913, SECTION FIVE, Image 59 with the caption:\n&quot;Ostend, in Belgium, is one of the most fashionable bathing beaches of the Continental coast. Bathing machines are used by both men and women. They hire them for use as dressing-rooms. As they take off their street clothing and put on their bathing togs, the bath man hitches his horse to the machine and takes it out into water several feet deep. Then he unhitches his horse and returns for another machine. The theory is that by going into the water direct from the machine you preserve your modesty. When you are through your swim, you signal the bath man, and he comes and draws the machine back to shore. When there is a great rush of bathers, these bathing machines cannot find room in the shallow water, and they are drawn up in two or three rows, the last row being high and dry on the sand.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1913-07-13/ed-1/seq-59/\" rel=\"nofollow\">oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1913-07-13/ed-1/se...</a>","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing_machine\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing_machine</a>","well, times have changed ! ...

It would be parked in huge specially created buildings that had no other purpose than to store the machine for the day.  At the end of the work period, the individual would fire the thing up and transport themselves back to their home where the machine would sit in a specially created structure until it was used the next day.

In August, 1956, when I was 13, I sailed to Europe with my parents and little sister on a Dutch ship, the RMS Maasdam. The crossing took nine days. There wasn't much for a kid to do: no TV, but the ship did have a couple of new movies that they showed over and over -- &quot;High Society,&quot; and Alec Guinness in &quot;The Ladykillers.&quot; By voyage's end, I had memorized them both, and probably another that I don't remember now. Grace Kelley and I were in love, but she didn't know it. \n\nI don't recall that the Maasdam was particularly yar . . . .","I recently researched The Sylph. I remember her when she carried my Aunt from the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan, NYC.  to Sea Gate, Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City. Sea Gate was a gated community on Coney Island, at the western tip of Long Island, in Brooklyn.

The US Navy originally purchased the &quot;SYLPH&quot; in June 1898 from her builder, John Roach &amp; Co., Chester, PA, and they commissioned the vessel as a Presidential Yacht on August 18, 1898 at the Norfolk Navy Yard.  The &quot;SYLPH&quot; served in this capacity for Presidents McKinley (1898-1901), Roosevelt (1901-1909), Taft (1909-1913) and Wilson (1913-1921).\n\nIn 1921, the Navy re-designated her as Patrol Yacht &quot;PY-5&quot; and she sailed on the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.  In 1925, she was permanently moored at the Washington Navy Yard, where she remained until her decommissioning in April 1929.  \n\nFrank B.

Thanks.","I got his birth date from his passport application of 1913 which I found in US Passport Applications 1789-1925 at ancestry.com  The application, which is signed by Mr Wood, gives his birth date as January 9, 1885.  The application appears to have been filled out by someone other than the signatory, however, so perhaps it is not as reliable as it first appears.\n\nSo I went back and searched for more evidence.   The 1900 US Census of Bible Grove IL includes a Clyde M Wood, son of Leander Wood, who was born in January 1885.  The 1910 Census of the same place also has &quot; C M Wood, aged 25, teacher&quot; who appears to be the same individual. \n\nKeep the pictures coming Pete.
