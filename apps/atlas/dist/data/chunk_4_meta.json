In telling of Dolly, the song alludes to many topical events and stage personalities--Lillian Russell, David Belasco, Charlie Frohman, Leslie Carter, Duse.

His father was a prominent Confederate States of America politician during the American Civil War. He graduated from Georgetown University with a Master of Laws in 1884.\n\nCharles married Lucy Floyd Mosby in 1879. After her death he married her sister Lelia James Mosby in 1885. They had three children, John W. Russell, Margaret Moore Russell (Mosby) and Lucy Virginia Russell. Lucy married Alfred James Ogster in 1917. He was the British Consul in Galveston, Texas.\n\nC. W. Russell entered the Department of Justice, Washington in 1886. He was a U.S. Assistant Attorney General and U.S. Minister to Persia (1909-14).  He successfully argued many French spoliation cases, the Maine explosion case and was involved with many Panama Canal issues.\n\nCharles W. Russell wrote a play &quot;Cuba Libre&quot; and four collections of poems, including &quot;The Secret Place and Other Poems&quot; (1911) and &quot;Iranian Rest and Other Lyrics&quot; (1912).  He also edited the &quot;Memoirs of Colonel John Singleton Mosby&quot; (his brother-in-law) in 1917.\n\n<i>In the news:</i>&nbsp; It could be this photograph was in the news in August and September of 1919 as details of the Versailles Treaty were being hammered out in an attempt to have it ratified by Congress. President Wilson was fundamentally opposed to any changes that would send the treaty back to Paris. Among many other issues, there were protests from Hungary, Albania, and Persia.   C. W. Russell, former American Minister to Persia spoke before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee saying that the Anglo-Persian Treaty robbed Persia of much of her sovereignty. Senator Philander C. Knox, former Secretary of State pushed for the right of self determination of Persia.\n[<a href=\"http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/russell2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]  [<a href=\"http://prabook.com/web/person-view.html?profileId=1070539\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>]  [<a href=\"http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/lp-2001/russell_ch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>]  [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F01E7DF153AE03ABC4B53DFBF668382609EDE\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>]  [<a href=\"https://access.newspaperarchive.com/us/washington-dc/washington/washington-post/1917/02-04/page-27?&amp;tag=charles+w+russell&amp;rtserp=tags/?psi=23&amp;pci=7&amp;ndt=by&amp;py=1910&amp;pey=1919&amp;pep=charles-w-russell&amp;psb=relavance\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>]  [<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025779/1919-09-20/ed-1/seq-11/#date1=01/01/1919&amp;index=0&amp;date2=12/31/1919&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Charles+Russell+W&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=Charles+W.+Russell&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">6</a>]\n\n\nThere is an additional <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2016706929/\" rel=\"nofollow\">photograph</a> of Charles W.

W. Sims was assaulted in Farragut Square [Washington, DC] by <b>Charles C. Glover</b>, President of the Riggs National Bank, one of the most prominent men in Washington financial and social circles.\n\n&quot;The assault was the outcome of criticism directed at Mr. Glover by Mr. Sims on the floor of the House of Representatives [four years earlier] in connection with Mr. Glover's effort to sell to the government a large tract of land adjoining Rock Creek Park [in Washington].\n\nMr. Glover said, <blockquote>&quot;I looked at him squarely in the face and said, &quot;I want to tell you to your face that you are a contemptible liar, yes, a miserable contemptible liar. Furthermore, I mean to show you just what I think of you.'\n\n&quot;With that, I struck Sims a blow squarely on the jaw...&quot;</blockquote>While Congressman Sims did not press the matter a congressional investigation was begun a few days later.\n\nUltimately, the matter was resolved when Speaker of the House James &quot;Champ&quot; Clark (D-Mo.) issued a warrant for Glover’s arrest and reprimanded the banker on the House floor. <blockquote>&quot;If one person is permitted to go unpunished for an assault upon a Congressman, everybody can assault a Congressman for words used in debate on the floor of the House, and free speech is at an end&quot;, Clark said just before he released Glover.</blockquote>[As an FYI aside, any speech made by an elected legislator – from a town meeting/city council member to a member of the U.S. Congress, on the floor of that respective body is <u>protected</u> speech, and is not subject to any action for libel, slander, defamation, etc.]\n\n&quot;Yet Glover eventually had the last word in land preservation. For example, one bill he lobbied for finally passed Congress in a compromise that created the National Zoo, a more popular possibility among Members, and opened the door to a commission that established Rock Creek Park. It was just one of the many fights Glover fought on behalf of the District. In fact, Glover, after whom Glover Park was named, went on to help create a city that would be very different today had he not played his part.&quot; &nbsp;[<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9900E7DA173FE633A25750C2A9629C946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]  [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950DE2D81139E633A25753C2A9629C946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>]  [<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/-37202-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>]  [<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/-37202-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>]  [<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/in-the-case-of-charles-c-glover-for-assault-upon-representative-thetus-w-sims-hearings-before-the-united-states-house-select-committee-appointed-pursuant-to-h-res-59-sixty-third-congress-first-session-on-apr-22-1913/oclc/968382807\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>]","<b>David Edmonston</b> (D.

She started performing on stage, including juvenile roles in the 1880s.\n\n&quot;She sang in a contralto, learning songs by ear, and lacked the ability to read music or play an instrument. Her repertoire included ballads, ragtime, vaudeville, and comedy in a variety of dialects.  During 1893–1894, she recorded for Edison Records on wax cylinders, making her among the earliest female singers to be recorded.   She sang with Billy Murray, Billy Watkins, Cal Stewart, Len Spencer, the American Quartet, and with her 12-year-old daughter <b>Sheilah</b>.  Touring was made difficult due to epilepsy.\n\n&quot;In 1893 or 1894 she recorded some musical performances for the North American Phonograph Company, including &quot;Sweet Marie&quot; and &quot;The Volunteer Organist&quot;. But the demise of this company interrupted her recording career and it was not until 1905 that she returned to recording, after a few years doing performances at such locations as Huber's 14th Street Museum in New York City.\n\n&quot;Ada Jones recorded &quot;The Yama Yama Man&quot; in 1909 for the Victor Light Opera Company.

He later advocated U.S. participation in World War I, negotiated the Lansing–Ishii Agreement with Japan in 1917 and was a member of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace at Paris in 1919.\n\n&quot;In 1919, Lansing became the nominal head of the US Commission to the Paris Peace Conference. Because he did not regard the League of Nations as essential to the peace treaty, Lansing began to fall out of favor with Wilson, for whom participation in the League of Nations was a primary goal. During Wilson's stroke and illness, Lansing called the cabinet together for consultations on several occasions. In addition, he was the first cabinet member to suggest that Vice President Thomas R. Marshall assume the powers of the presidency. Edith Wilson was displeased by Lansing's independence, and requested Lansing's resignation in 1920.\n\n&quot;In 1890, Lansing married <b>Eleanor Foster</b> (1866-1934), the daughter of Secretary of State John W. Foster.  Eleanor's older sister Edith was the mother of John Foster Dulles, who also became Secretary of State, Allen Welsh Dulles who served as Director of Central Intelligence, and Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economist and high level policy analyst and advisor for the State Department.\n\n&quot;New York State Senator Robert Lansing (1799–1878) was his grandfather; Chancellor John Lansing, Jr. and State Treasurer Abraham G.

Born in the Bahamas on November 12, 1874, he came to the United States permanently in 1885.\n\n&quot;Williams met George Walker in San Francisco in 1893 and the two formed what became the most successful comedy team of their time. After appearing on Broadway in Victor Herbert's The Gold Bug (1896), Williams and Walker created pioneering vaudeville shows and full musical theater productions, including Senegambian Carnival (1897), The Policy Players (1899), The Sons of Ham (1900), their biggest hit, In Dahomey (1902)--which also played in London the following year, Abyssinia (1906), and Bandana Land (1907).\n\n&quot;When Walker retired in 1908 due to illness, Williams starred in Mr. Load of Koal (1909)--the last black musical on Broadway for more than ten years. Unable to continue producing shows without Walker, Williams signed on with the Ziegfeld Follies in 1910--the only black performer in this famous review. He explained this controversial move saying, &quot;... colored show business is at a low ebb just now ... it was far better to have joined a large white show than to have starred in a colored show, considering conditions.&quot; Williams stayed with the Follies through 1919, after which he appeared with Eddie Cantor in Broadway Brevities (1920) and Under the Bamboo Tree (1921-22). While on tour with the latter show, his failing health caught up with him and he contracted pneumonia. Williams died in New York City on March 4, 1922.\n\n&quot;Williams was also one of the most prolific black performers on recordings, making around 80 recordings from 1901-22. Indeed, his first recording sessions with George Walker for the Victor Company in 1901 are considered the first recordings by black performers for a major recording company. Williams signed with Columbia in 1906 and the majority of his recordings were with that company, including what became his signature number, &quot;Nobody,&quot; with words written by Alex Rogers.&quot;\n\n<i>–From <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200038860/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BIOGRAPHIES</a> • Selected Works at the Library of Congress.</i>\n\nThis publicity still portrait was reportedly taken on January 01, 1920.

It was one of ten C class non-rigid airships built by Goodyear and Goodrich primarily for training and patrol duty for the navy during World War I.\nHistory\n\nThe C-5's engines were built by Hispano-Suiza, and its control car was built by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In early May 1919, the C-5 made a pioneering flight from its home base at Cape May, New Jersey to Montauk Point, New York and St. John's, Newfoundland, becoming the first airship to reach that city and in the process sending the first radio voice transmission from Newfoundland. The C-5's goal was to fly across the Atlantic, paralleling the route used by the U.S. seaplane NC-4. Previous attempts to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a balloon were unsuccessful. The most famous of these attempts was that of the dirigible America in October 1910.\n\nOn 14 May 1919, the C-5 departed Montauk Point in clear weather. It made good time, but encountered heavy fog and thunderstorms near Saint Pierre Island, Canada and became lost for several hours. It eventually regained its way, but the extended trip caused the crew to exhaust its food supply and wind and rain continuously buffeted the blimp. The C-5 again became lost, this time over Newfoundland itself, when its radio navigation equipment malfunctioned. The C-5's crew used its voice radio to contact the U.S. Navy cruiser Chicago, which was in St. John's, and the radio signal was used to guide the C-5 to the tracks of the Colonial Railroad, which it followed to St. John's and a safe landing at 11 a.m. on 15 May. The commander of the blimp, Lieutenant Commander Coll, said it was the roughest trip he had ever experienced.\n\nMost of the crew left to eat lunch and sleep, while the few remaining men began to service the blimp's engines. In the meantime, a storm rolled in and additional cables were tied over the blimp in order to secure it and crewmen from the Chicago were brought in to help. The wind intensified from 30 miles per hour (48 km/h) to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) with higher gusts, and the blimp began to break free from its additional cables. The engines couldn't be restarted because they were under maintenance, so Lieutenant Charles Little attempted to pull the emergency cord to open the gasbag and deflate it. The cord broke, and the C-5 began to lift off, tearing a few remaining cables that injured two crewmen as they sprang loose. Little jumped from the rising blimp, injuring his ankle, and the C-5 was blown eastward, over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe destroyer USS Edwards was dispatched to retrieve the blimp, which continued to drift. Later news reports that the C-5 crashed into the Atlantic and was found by a passing British ship were false.There were also reports that the C-5 may have been sighted over Ireland, but these were never substantiated. The C-5 was never seen again.\n\nOn the same day the C-5 broke loose from its moorings, the British government announced plans to send the airship R-34 on a transatlantic flight to Cape May, the C-5's home base. That airship successfully crossed the Atlantic, becoming the first aircraft to navigate that body of water from east to west nonstop.\nSpecifications (typical C class blimp)\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\n    Crew: Four\n    Length: 196 ft 0 in (59.76 m)\n    Diameter: 42 ft 0 in (12.80 m)\n    Height: 54 ft 0 in (16.46 m)\n    Volume: 181,000 ft3 (5,125 m3)\n    Useful lift: 4,050 lb (1,837 kg)\n    Powerplant: 2 × Hispano-Suiza, 150 hp (112 kW) each\n\nPerformance\n\n    Maximum speed: 60 mph (97 km/h)\n    Cruise speed: 40 mph (64 km/h)\n    Range: 1,440 miles (2,320 km)\n    Endurance: 31 hours  30 min\n    Service ceiling: 8,600 ft (2,620 m)\n\nArmament\n\n    1 × .303 Lewis gun\n    4 × 270 lb (122 kg) bombs\n\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-5_%28blimp%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-5_%28blimp%29</a>","Thank you Program Executive Office Soldier, this helps us know more about the specific blimp!","Emile Joseph Dillon (Dublin, 21 March 1854 – 9 June 1933, Barcelona, Spain), author, journalist and linguist\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Dillon\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Dillon</a>\n\nS. also photos in\n<a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw95298/Emile-Joseph-Dillon\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw95298/Emile-...</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.illustratedfirstworldwar.com/item/the-balkan-puzzle-bulgaria-and-the-entente-iln0-1915-1030-0017-001/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.illustratedfirstworldwar.com/item/the-balkan-puzzle-b...</a>","his New York Times obituary:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9907EFDA123DEF32A25753C1A9609C946294D6CF&amp;legacy=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9907EFDA123DEF32A...</a>","Thanks, we can add full name to record.","<a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge,_1._Earl_of_Athlone\" rel=\"nofollow\">de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge,_1._Earl_of_Ath...</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge,_1st_Earl_of_Athlone\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge,_1st_Earl_of_At...</a>\nSee <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001330/in/photolist-9c2LgW-RWKTLQ-7VEaYn-8WkxkY-9yKds6-9yNe8q\" title=\"Prince of Teck  (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5269/5622001330_c3c1b9e08b_m.jpg\" width=\"176\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Prince of Teck  (LOC)\" /></a> when he was Prince of Teck.","See <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6311899765/in/photolist-4jCA7j-4i8sMH-4Jse7m-4jyER8-eXtmjJ-8Y5K8f-4jyDkr-nUCXNP-4i8w7t-4i7rMM-aBL8U2-8Y63Nf-4i8vZB-4i8MkK-bv4SqP-4i8wpD-4jCHqS-4jCHms-8Y63SQ-8Y3akH-8Y5Xyo-4i7bua-qZCjpN-4i8wfZ-nCpQQB-pXDKA3-8Y2XAX-4i7suc-4icCjf-6xN2gu-4i7q1V-5ha2Y2-aZCr1B-4i8rsk-4i7tGz-4ibEMm-4ibxYG-4ibmMm-4idwV1-dm4fnQ-4i9ydi-bR3rtp-8Y668G-8Y64GU-8Y6aKh-bC8KqC-bC8K5h-4ZcAFu-6PxyAz-z5LA2H\" title=\"Earl of Dalhousie  (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6057/6311899765_c4308672d3_m.jpg\" width=\"174\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Earl of Dalhousie  (LOC)\" /></a>\nfor another photo with this style of dress uniform, used by several British Guards Regiments.","Thanks, we can add bio note to records.","Margaret Elizabeth Leigh Child-Villiers (29 October 1849 – 22 May 1945), Countess of Jersey\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Elizabeth_Leigh\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Elizabeth_Leigh</a>\n\nS. also photo in <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw145838/Margaret-Elizabeth-Child-Villiers-ne-Leigh-Countess-of-Jersey-as-Anne-of-Austria\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw145838/Marga...</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-5_\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-5_</a>(blimp)\n&quot;C-5 was a hydrogen inflated C class blimp operated by the U.S. Navy in 1918 and 1919.

He made important contributions to the technical and organizational development of naval aviation from its very beginnings, eventually serving as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics (1939–1942). He commanded carrier task forces during World War II, and retired in December 1947. &quot;\n&quot;In 1919, then-Commander Towers proposed, planned and led the first air crossing of the Atlantic. Planning for the mission actually began during the early years of World War I, when Allied shipping was threatened by submarine warfare, but could not be accomplished prior to the war's end. The flying expedition began on 8 May 1919 when three Curtiss NC Flying Boats, designated NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4, left Naval Air Station Rockaway, New York, The aircraft made intermediate stops in Chatham, Massachusetts and Halifax, Nova Scotia before reaching Trepassey, Newfoundland on 15 May 1919.\n\nOn 16 May they left for the longest leg of their journey, to the Azores. NC-1 and the NC-3 were both forced to land in heavy seas due to dense fog, and neither could take off again. NC-1 subsequently began taking on water and the crew was rescued by the Greek freighter Ionia The crew of the NC-3, including Towers, managed to keep the NC-3 afloat for 52 hours, water taxiing the craft over 200 miles to Punta Delgada on Sao Miguel Island. NC-4 went on to complete the transatlantic crossing, arriving at Lisbon on 27 May. For his leadership in the operation, Towers was awarded the Navy Cross. Ten years later, Towers and the flight crew of NC-4 were awarded Congressional Gold Medals.&quot;","See also\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/31788348776/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/31788348776/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4953636101/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4953636101/</a>","And a later portrait by Harris &amp; Ewing held by LoC: \n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/hec.21797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/hec.21797/</a>","Thank you swanq and B-59 for information on the pioneer aviator John Henry Towers.

In addition, Douglas MacArthur, then a major, suggested to William A. Mann, the head of the Militia Bureau, that he form another division from the non-divisional units of several states. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker approved the proposal, and recalled Douglas MacArthur saying that such an organization would &quot;stretch over the whole country like a rainbow.&quot; The division was created using units from 26 states and the District of Columbia.

Albert F. Hegenberger completed the first transpacific flight from California to Hawaii, flying the modified transport Bird of Paradise. Although the recognition accorded them was less in comparison with the adulation given Charles Lindbergh for his transatlantic flight only five weeks earlier, Maitland and Hegenberger's feat was arguably more significant from a navigational stand point.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_J._Maitland\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_J._Maitland</a>\n\n&quot;Albert Francis Hegenberger (September 30, 1895 – August 31, 1983) was a Major General in the United States Air Force and a pioneering aviator who set a flight distance record with Lester J.

Captain Vallois volunteered to fly with Major Lewis H. Brereton on an important reconnaissance mission. On account of poor visibility they were forced to fly at a very low altitude and were continually harassed by antiaircraft fire. Four enemy monoplanes (type Fokker) attacked them, and during the combat which followed Captain Vallois' gun jammed. After withdrawing for the purpose of clearing the jam they again returned to the fight, and, despite the fact that he had been painfully wounded in the face, Captain Vallois succeeded in dispersing three of the adversaries and fought off the other while his pilot made a landing.\nGeneral Orders No. 46, W.D., 1919\nResident of France&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/books/foreign/02_FOREIGN-DSCwwi.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.homeofheroes.com/valor/books/foreign/02_FOREIGN-DSCww...</a>","&quot;Ira Beaman Joralemon (1884 – 1975) was an American mining engineer, economic geologist, and mining company executive, who specialized in exploration and mining of copper ore deposits.

In addition to his professional career within the minerals industry, he was also a popular science author and historian of the mining industry.\n[...]\nHis work with the C&amp;A Company was interrupted by World War I, during which Joralemon served with the United States Army Air Service between 1917 and 1919.

It caused Frees so much anxiety that he photographed his furry subjects for only three months a year.

He was born in Montclair, New Jersey and died in Sepulveda, California, at age 79.\nProfessional career[edit]\nFerguson was one of the first forkball specialists in major league history. He entered the majors in 1918 with the New York Yankees, playing for them two years (1918, 1921) before joining the Boston Red Sox (1922–1925), Washington Senators (1925–1926), again the Yankees (1925), and with the Philadelphia Phillies (1927–1929) and Brooklyn Robins (1925). He enjoyed his highest win season in 1924 with the seventh-place Red Sox, when he won 14 games while losing an American League-high 17. In 1925 he divided his playing time with Boston, New York and Washington, ending with a 5–1 mark and a 3.25 ERA in seven games for the Senators AL champion team. During the World Series, he pitched well against the Pittsburgh Pirates, going 1–1 with a 3.21 ERA in two starts.\nIn a 10-season career, Ferguson posted a 61–85 record with 397 strikeouts and a 4.89 ERA in 257 appearances, including 166 starts, 62 complete games, two shutouts, 10 saves, and 1241⅔ innings of work.\nIn 1926 Ferguson set a major league record for the highest ERA during a regular season by a pitcher who started a postseason game the same year. Ferguson collected a combined 6.18 ERA while pitching with the Red Sox, Yankees and Senators. The mark was broken in 2006 by Óliver Pérez of the New York Mets, who posted a 6.55 ERA during the regular season before starting Game 4 of the NL Championship Series.","really odd sharpness &amp; depth of field with these leaf shutter lenses","&quot;Charles Prestwich Scott (26 October 1846 – 1 January 1932), usually cited as C.

According to an op-ed that Afroilan and Williams wrote for The Daily Californian: “David Prescott Barrows described Pilipinxs (spelling to denote gender-neutrality) as ‘savages’ and implemented a system of colonial education meant to ‘civilize’ and reform ‘the vicious system of teaching in current Filipino schools.’”\n\nBarrows’ attempts to westernize and “whitewash” this marginalized minority group undermines the legitimacy of their culture in preference for the superiority of the white systems. The core beliefs Barrows held stand in stark juxtaposition of the ethnic studies and gender and women’s studies departments, which are both currently housed within the building. The dichotomy of a building simultaneously endorsing and criticizing white supremacy is quite an ironic paradox — especially when it’s on UC Berkeley grounds, the premier location for protests against injustice and inequality. “Our art is a form of protest,” Afroilan said.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/04/rename-barrows-art-movement/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dailycal.org/2016/03/04/rename-barrows-art-movement/</a>","The New York herald., April 23, 1922, SECTION TWO, Page 4 printed this photo\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/1922-04-23/ed-1/seq-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/1922-04-23/ed-...</a>","Thanks all for the details about Barrows.

As NC-1 had been damaged during a March storm, one wing of the experimental NC-2 was used to refit it. To increase the margin of safety, a fourth pusher-type engine was added behind the original central engine.\n\nNext, the Navy selected crews to man the three planes, appointing Towers as commanding officer. Crews came from the Regular Navy, the Naval Reserve and the U.S. Coast Guard. Towers chose NC-3 as his flagship, and Richardson was picked as chief pilot. Patrick N.L. Bellinger was chosen as commander for NC-1 and Albert C. Read for NC-4. Marc Mitscher, originally picked to command the now scrubbed NC-2, became NC-1‘s pilot. In addition, the airplanes carried radio operators, flight engineers and mechanics.\n\nDuring WWI, Richard E. Byrd had experimented with a number of scientific instruments, ranging from drift indicators to bubble sextants, that were useful in navigating over water, without visual landmarks. Although Byrd lobbied hard to join the 1919 flight, instead the Navy assigned him to plan the navigation for the flying boats only as far as Trepassey Bay.&quot;\n\nmore at <a href=\"http://www.historynet.com/aviation-history-three-us-flying-boats-were-the-first-to-fly-across-the-atlantic-in-1919.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.historynet.com/aviation-history-three-us-flying-boats...</a>","Have not found the exact photo this series was cropped from, but another taken at the same time is at \n<a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/us-people/b/byrd-richard-e-up-to-1920/nh-53322.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/us-peopl...</a>\nwith the caption:\n&quot;Naval Aviation Board, preparing for the NC Trans-Atlantic Flight, 1919\nPhotographed while preparing for the trans-Atlantic flight of the NC Aircraft, circa spring 1919.

While on a protection patrol for American observation planes from the 99th Aero Squadron, Lieutenant Simon was fired upon by three Halberstadt biplane fighters. Regardless of his personal danger, he immediately engaged the enemy, although alone, drawing them down and away from the observation planes which continued their important work unmolested. Lieutenant Simon continued fighting the three Halberstadts fiercely in spite of the odds against him. He finally succeeded in getting on the tail of one; and, after firing a short burst at close range, the enemy plane fell out of control. The remaining two planes quickly broke off the combat and headed east with motors full on.\nGeneral Orders No. 44, W.D., 1919\nBirth: Columbus, OH\nHome Town: Columbus, OH\nOther Award: Distinguished Service Cross w/OLC (WWI)\n\nSIMON, LOUIS C., JR.\n(Second Award)\nFirst Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army\nPilot, 147th Aero Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group, Air Service, A.E.F.\nDate of Action: October 23, 1918\nCitation:\nThe Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Louis C.

Sascha Jacobsen was the performer, and after the youthful artist had played a Fugue by Tartini, in the dress given it by Fritz Kreisler, the hall buzzed with laudatory comments. Mr. Jacobsen has now played in public often enough to be associated in the public mind with the young geniuses who have come from Russia in the course of the last five years, but last night he established his right to be associated with some of the best of them. He is artistically a product of New York, a pupil of Mr. Kneisel. He draws a tine, full, musical tone from his instrument and a sound, virile appreciation of beauty speaks out of every thing that he does. Besides the Tartini Fugue. he played a Corelli Sonata, which disclosed the firm foundation of his musicianship; the Mendelssohn concerto and a group of short pieces, sentimental and brilliant, to gratify the taste of the multitude.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1919-01-08/ed-1/seq-11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1919-01-08/ed-...</a>","Thank you Art Siegel and B-59.

So they, especially the two children in the foreground, put the pencil on any part of the already printed sheet.

The strike began at 10 a.m. on February 6, 1919,  and lasted for four days. Sixty thousand workers went off their jobs and brought to Seattle an almost complete cessation of business.\nWarren prepared for the strike by hiring hundreds of University of Washington fraternity men and deputizing them as special officers. Also, a contingent of troops from Camp Lewis was on hand. Throughout the strike there was no public disorder and police reported fewer calls than usual.\nLabor remembered Warren’s reputation as a strikebreaker in Idaho 26 years earlier and criticized his tactics in the Seattle General Strike. On February 9, 1919, he ordered a raid on Socialist Party headquarters, arresting three men for circulating the party’s newspaper. Next he raided the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) hall and arrested 39 men because he was &quot;tired of reading their revolutionary circulars.&quot; Earlier he had ordered the breakup of a parade of 500 &quot;Reds&quot; and arrested 13 without charge. During the General Strike he closed a print shop for printing radical literature. Later he placed officers on the premises to censor anything that might be printed.

His shrewd domestic reforms gave Prussia a strong position in the post-Westphalian political order of north-central Europe, setting Prussia up for elevation from duchy to kingdom, achieved under his son and successor.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William,_Elector_of_Brandenburg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William,_Elector_of_Brand...</a>","From a painting by Wilhelm Camphausen (1818-1885)\n<a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.ae/detail/news-photo/friedrich-wilhelm-16-02-1620-09-05-1688-portrait-on-a-news-photo/541550849#friedrich-wilhelm-1602162009051688portrait-on-a-horsepainting-from-picture-id541550849\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gettyimages.ae/detail/news-photo/friedrich-wilhelm-16...</a>\n\n&quot;Wilhelm Camphausen (8 February 1818, Düsseldorf – 16 June 1885, Düsseldorf), was a German painter who specialized in historical and battle scenes.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Camphausen\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Camphausen</a>","a variant published in 1881, with the title &quot;Der große Kurfürst mit General Derfflinger.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Die_Gartenlaube_(1871)_b_853.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Die_Gartenlaube_(1871)_b_853.jpg</a>\n&quot;Georg von Derfflinger (20 March 1606 – 14 February 1695) was a field marshal in the army of Brandenburg-Prussia during and after the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648).&quot;\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_von_Derfflinger\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_von_Derfflinger</a>","At Fehrbellin, June 18, 1675\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fehrbellin\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fehrbellin</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/66311327@N05/29851521624/\">www.flickr.com/photos/66311327@N05/29851521624/</a>","Thank you Art Siegel, we'll update our catalog record.","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_III,_German_Emperor\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_III,_German_Emperor</a>\nSee also <a href=\"http://www.reformation.org/kaiser-frederick3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.reformation.org/kaiser-frederick3.html</a> and","This looks to be a photo of an 1874 portrait by Heinrich von Angeli of Friedrich as Crown Prince.","Thanks swanq, we'll add this information to the catalog record.","This was published in a February 1919 publication, credited to the &quot;Committee on Public Information&quot;\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/reviewofreviewsw59newy/reviewofreviewsw59newy#page/133/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.org/stream/reviewofreviewsw59newy/reviewofreviews...</a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwplarchives/4303356095/in/photolist-9bYGqH-f9Vhz2-69ygUn-cDXTwN-7ygPQK-7LSirm-69Ctsh-a85nsx-aUTqig-7NyKwG-aUToaX-aUTpiv-69yfsP-5ERSyg-aUToPp\" title=\"The Wilsons in France\"><img src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/5/4013/4303356095_eeb70dd84d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" alt=\"The Wilsons in France\" /></a>\n\n&quot;Raymond Poincaré (French pronunciation: ​[ʁɛmɔ̃ pwɛ̃kaʁe]; 20 August 1860 – 15 October 1934) was a French statesman who served three times as Prime Minister of France, and as President of France from 1913 to 1920.

It showed the American eagle swooping low in its flight to drop a wreath of laurel on the head of the British lion. The design was archaistic and done in masses of black against the light background formed by a beautiful grained panel of wood. In the figures of the eagle and lion there was slight but clear delineation effected by firmly drawn lines of white against the mass of black. From a pictorial standpoint this was the most original design Cooper had executed up to that time. In all the annals of art, primitive and present,  oriental and occidental,  the precedent for that lion and that eagle cannot be found. In design,  as in lettering therefore,  Cooper's war period gave evidence of distinctive originality.&quot;\n\nThe Poster, December 1, 1922\n\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KTJGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA10-PA6&amp;lpg=RA10-PA6&amp;dq=f.g.+cooper,+britain's+day&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yqUByvGzsp&amp;sig=JD7Ht49Nn44AKmw6XEjmKRN2_Uw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB1rvgmdvPAhVJ34MKHRwoD4sQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=f.g. cooper, britain's day&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=KTJGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA10-PA6&amp;am...</a>\n\nColor reproduction at  <a href=\"https://art.famsf.org/fg-cooper/americas-tribute-britain-world-war-i-poster-19771193\" rel=\"nofollow\">art.famsf.org/fg-cooper/americas-tribute-britain-world-wa...</a>","The poster was created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Montgomery_Flagg\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Montgomery Flagg</a>, s.\n<a href=\"https://vepca.wordpress.com/tag/vepca-com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">vepca.wordpress.com/tag/vepca-com/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2002712329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/item/2002712329/</a>","see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/30023544450/in/photostream/\" title=\"Mrs. L.C.

Filloux to fill a vital French Army requirement for a heavy artillery piece. The design proved a success and became the standard heavy field gun of the French from 1917 through to the end of World War II. \nThis weapon was pressed into service as soon as it was made ready to stabilize the shortage of such weapons in the French inventory. \nThis weapon became the &quot;Canon de 155 Grande Puissance Filloux mle 1917&quot;, named by French Army as the Canon de 155mm GPF (Model of 1917). During World War 1, the gun was eventually taken on by the American Expeditionary Force as a standard long-range artillery piece.[3]\nAt the beginning of World War II the French guns were pulled out of reserve storage, and 24 of these guns were mobilized/on active duty in May-June 1940.&quot;\n\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_de_155mm_GPF\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_de_155mm_GPF</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Semyonov\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Semyonov</a>","That's a great hat.","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_James_Eugene_Woodbridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_James_Eugene_Woodbridge</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Memorial_Library\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Memorial_Library</a>","&quot;Frederick James Eugene Woodbridge (1867, New York – 1940, New York) was a teacher at various American universities.

The concept came from a poem written by a MU College of Agriculture graduate who perished in World War I.\n\nRobert McGhee “Peaches” Graham (1892 – 1918) and his Army friends wrote the poem, which calls for the construction of a bell tower on the MU campus to memorialize the University’s war dead. His poem also suggested naming MU’s football stadium Memorial Stadium.\n\nGraham was a native of Montgomery County, Mo. He came from a Scottish pioneer family who ran farms on land originally owned by Daniel Boone. Family orchards earned him his nickname while attending Mizzou from 1911 to 1915.\n\nGraham is said to have been one of the most popular students on campus, active in student life and bubbling with ideas to improve his school. He played center during his senior year as a varsity football player.\n\nAfter earning his Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Agriculture he began graduate work in the school’s Department of Veterinary Medicine, intending to earn his living as a veterinarian. He left MU to return home and run one of the family farms.\n\nFarmers were excluded from service in World War I, but Graham turned down that exemption and enlisted in August 1917. He was commissioned as a captain in the U.S. Army, and his regiment was sent to France in 1918 where he wrote the poem. He mailed the manuscript back to MU faculty with a plea not to forget the soldiers.\n\nGraham was killed in action while patrolling enemy lines at St. Pie on July 27, 1918. &quot;\nmore at:\n<a href=\"http://cafnrnews.com/2013/12/a-poem-to-remember/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cafnrnews.com/2013/12/a-poem-to-remember/</a>","Thank you Art Siegel for the interesting story about Robert Graham.

Here is a description of one visit by Colonel Harrison Howell Dodge:\n\n“President Woodrow Wilson several times honored Mount Vernon by his presence, but quite the most spectacular event in which he took part was on the Fourth of July, 1918, when he brought as his guests, on the Mayflower, fifty or more delegates representing the thousands of foreign-born citizens of the United States, wishing, by this public commemoration of our Declaration of Independence, to testify their loyalty to America. Each delegate bore a handsome wreath distinguished by his respective national colors, the collection quite filling the Tomb.\n\n“It was estimated that nearly 20,000 persons were present on that notable day: “The Star Spangled Banner” was sung by John McCormack, who insisted on being accompanied by a Steinway Grand piano. The instrument, so inappropriate beside the Tomb of Washington, was entirely screened from view by hastily planted cedars.”\n<a href=\"http://www.mountvernon.org/the-estate-gardens/famous-visitors/article/president-woodrow-wilson/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mountvernon.org/the-estate-gardens/famous-visitors/ar...</a>","This photo was published in the New York Sun., July 14, 1918, Section 4 Pictorial Magazine, Image 35\n  <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1918-07-14/ed-1/seq-35/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1918-07-14/ed-...</a>\nCaptioned &quot;President Wilson reading his Fourth of July speech to the representatives of foreign nations in the shadow of Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon on July 4.

Sergeant Lusher was 20 years old and was graduated from the Westport High school, Kansas City Mo.  He was refused a commission in the first officers training camp on account of his youth, but remained in the army and went to France with a regiment of regulars to which he had been transferred at his own request in order to get into action without delay.  He was associated with the Opie Brush Co until his enlistment. Mr Lusher has spent his vacations from childhood learning the brush business.  During the year from his graduation until his enlistment he served in the capacity of sales manager for the firm.  He had a wide acquaintance and a host of friends. He was a boy of winning personality and a great future was predicted for him. The one thought which sustains his many friends is that he laid down his life on the Altar of Supreme Sacrifice. He was a brother of Mrs John T Opie,  4001 East Sixty eighth street,  and of Mrs George E Mason,  2735 Robert Gillham Road,  Kansas Mo.

(Sumter, S.C.), August  7, 1918:\n\n&quot;SUMTER'S FIRST SACRIFICE.\n\nLieut. Robert O. Purdy, Jr., Killed in\nAction July 21st [...]\n\nFor days, ever since the great bat-\ntle on the Marne began, Sumter has\nbeen tense with dread and anxiety,\nfearing that the next report of cas-\nualties would contain the names of\nsome of the Sumter boys who are\nfighting with Pershing's men to drive\nthe Huns out of France and turn\nback the wave of barbarism that for\nfour years has been dashing against\nthe ramparts of civilization. Late\nFriday afternoon the dreaded news\ncame in a message to Judge R. O.\nPurdy, from the War Department,\nsaying that Lieut. Robert O. Purdy.\nJr., had been killed in action on July\n21st. The message gave no particu-\nlars, merely the fact that one of our\nboys had died at the post of duty\nwhere the Americans and the French\nwere driving the Huns back from the\nMarne. The news spread rapidly\nover the town and every home be-\ncame a house of mourning and Judgej\nPurdy's personal sorrow was shared \nby one and all.\n\nLieut. Purdy. was twenty-seven\nyears old, the eldest son of Judge R.\nO. Purdy and was born and reared\nin this city, attended the city schools\nand afterwards the University of\nSouth Carolina, completing his law \ncourse there with the class of 1914.\nFrom his graduation until last spring\nhe was associated with his father in\nthe practice of law in this city, at\nwhich time he entered the first offi-\ncers' training camp at Fort Ogle-\nthorpe. He was commissioned sec- \nond lieutenant of infantry and vol-\nunteered for immediate service in\nFrance, and after a short stay at home\nsailed for France early in September.\nHe went into active service with the\nfirst American forces sent to the bat-\ntle front and spent the winter in the\ntrenches. In the spring he was gassed\nand was in a hospital for weeks and\nlater was assigned to duty in the\nrear, a few weeks ago was re-as-\nsigned to active service with his old\ncommand, at his own request. One\nof the last letters received from him \nbrought the news that he would re- \nturn to the firing line the next day.\nRobert Purdy volunteered for service\nnot because he loved a fight or be-\ncause he was of an adventurous dis\nposition eager for the excitement to\nbe found in the army on the field of\nbattle, but because he felt that he was\ncalled to perform a duty by his coun-\ntry. He gave himself cheerfully with\nthe full realization that he might\nprobably would, have to make the su-\npreme sacrifice. He died at the front\nnear the flashing of the guns with\nother young Americans animated by \na like spirit of patriotism.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93067846/1918-08-07/ed-1/seq-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93067846/1918-08-07/ed-...</a>\n\nHis memorial in Sumter, S.C.\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=68247517\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=68247517</a>\nand his grave in France:\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=purdy&amp;GSfn=robert&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdy=1918&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=56639812&amp;df=all&amp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=purdy&...</a>;","Thank you, B-59 and AS, we can add full name to record.","Robert Obadiah Purdy Jr. (1891-1918)\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107899217\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107899217</a>","The Comforts Committee of the U.S. Navy League sponsored a knitting bee in the Mall, Central Park on July 29th to August 1st, 1918.
