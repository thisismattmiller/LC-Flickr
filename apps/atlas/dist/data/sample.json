Potter, prominent Casselton residents, he having within the last few days been given the rank of major. His promotion is from a captaincy and so far as can be learned here, makes him the youngest major in the entire United States service.\nAs major he now becomes a member of the general staff of the war department, and left California last Tuesday for Washington, D. C., in obedience to his new orders.\nMajor Potter, then a captaln with the Fifteenth Field artillery, was sent only two weeks ago from New York on special detail work to Presidio, Cal., and it was while at the latter place that he was notified of his promotion.

Working class humor also found popular expression in plays and on the vaudeville stage, appealing to a variety of ethnic groups, especially the Jewish, German and Irish. As a movement of the working class, socialism shared the same culture of humor as vaudeville. But the connection was even more direct: many actors, writers and vaudeville performers were themselves Socialists. In 1908 vaudeville performers organized the White Rats, a militant, left-wing union which staged many strike benefits for garment workers. Future impresario Sol Hurok organized extravagant Socialist parades and pageantry in Brooklyn; J.C. Frost, who wrote such working class Irish plays as &quot;The Walking Delegate,&quot; was a regular street corner speaker; August Claessens, teacher of street corner oratory and a popular speaker, was a former actor.&quot;","Thanks [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05], we'll update the catalog record.","According to the 1916 Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party for Manhattan, New York City\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=g6QJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA454\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">books.google.com/books?\nid=g6QJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA454</a>\nI have not found him in the 1900 or 1910 Manhattan census yet.","<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1562672\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1562672</a>","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4483945631]\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/sports/baseball/john-montgomery-ward-perfect-game.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">John Montgomery Ward</a>","This could be:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rothschild,_1st_Baron_Rothschild\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rothschild,_1st_Baron_Rothsc...</a>\n&quot;In 1885, Rothschild became a member of the House of Lords when he was created Baron Rothschild, of Tring in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.&quot;\n&quot;When he was raised to the peerage by Gladstone, Rothschild was the first Jewish member of the House of Lords not to have previously converted to Christianity.&quot;\n&quot;He died in London, five days after an operation, on 31 March 1915.&quot;\nor\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothschild\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothsc...</a>\n&quot;Walter inherited the British peerage title &quot;Baron Rothschild&quot; from his father Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild in 1915.

The subject was a monster Sikorsky biplane, the S-35, which was being equipped with three 425 h.p. Gnome-Rhone Jupiter motors specially selected abroad and shipped here by Fonck to drive him, without pausing, from Long Island to Paris next autumn in an effort to win a standing prize of $25,000.* A preliminary non-stop flight, Long Island to Halifax and back, was scheduled for early July. </blockquote>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%c3%a9_Fonck\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Fonck</a>\n'Colonel René Paul Fonck (27 March 1894 – 18 June 1953) was a French aviator who ended the First World War as the top Entente fighter ace and, when all succeeding aerial conflicts of the 20th and 21st centuries are also considered, Fonck still holds the title of &quot;all-time Allied Ace of Aces&quot;.'\n...\n'During the 1920s, Fonck persuaded Igor Sikorsky to redesign the Sikorsky S-35 for the transatlantic race or Orteig Prize.

April 6.—Sir Thomas Lipton's arrival in this country for the reported purpose of clearing the ground for a challenge for the America’s cup serves chiefly to remind yachting enthusiasts of the decay of the sport of racing and sailing big windjammers in this country.\nThere is a nautical strain in the American blood which will never be eliminated, and its effects are seen in the clouds of racing sailboats of the smaller classes that beautify the bays and rivers of the Atlantic Seaboard, the inland lakes of the Middle West and Pacific Coast waters.\nBut when it comes to the canvas-propelled leviathans which used to dominate the regattas of the New York Yacht Club there is a different story. With few exceptions the largest sloops now are of 40-foot water-line length, while schooners do not exceed 70 feet. And there are few enough of those.&quot;","Thomas Lipton did manage to get one more challenge accepted after 1926, but the next America's Cup was not until 1930.\n\nThe 1930 race and a few subsequent ones used J-class boats.\nSee <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Class_(yacht)\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Class_(yacht)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_V\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_V</a>\nThe boat built by Camper and Nicholson for Lipton for the 1930 race, was still in use and available for charter until very recently.\n\nHere she was in 2009:\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05/53579375444/in/dateposted-public/\" title=\"IMG_1629\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53579375444_92b6def138_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" alt=\"IMG_1629\" /></a>\n\nIn June 2023, she was having a refit.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/shamrock-v-yacht-restoration\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/shamrock-v-yacht-re...</a>","Thanks  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardarthurnorton] and [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05] , we'll update the catalog record.","Tito Schipa (1889-1965), Italian tenor \n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q456827\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q456827</a>","See earlier photos of Schipa in the Bain stream linked from:\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/51104822041/in/photolist-2kRXz8p-2kRXz41-2hGWwcp-2iqk3oU-YK7yTD-2hGWwuD-2hGWwkA-YK7xXk-YK7yDv-2jtW8tw-2igiAon-2kRXUgs-YK7ybX-2pCgn9o-2ighxf9-2maeHTm-2iLvyRs-2iLvyXV-2majW2J-2mafESg-2maindP-2maeHHg-2majVM5-2maeJ8z-2jtUJRP-2maeJ3p-2krfgzA-2kraYvE-2kreNAj\" title=\"Schipa (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51104822041_a511dc9188_n.jpg\" width=\"235\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Schipa (LOC)\" /></a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Schipa\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Schipa</a>\n&quot;Tito Schipa (Italian pronunciation: [ˈskiːpa]; born Raffaele Attilio Amedeo Schipa; 2 January 1889 in Lecce – 16 December 1965) was an Italian lyric tenor, considered the greatest tenore di grazia and one of the most popular tenors of the century.&quot;\n\nAn earlier picture with his wife is at:\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/50198949761/in/photolist-2jtUJRP-2mZrgor-kb1uxd-4vVACT-jmwrQg-2maeJ3p-2j75Cfu-2jtW84e-2krfgzA-27BvWB5-9RjRz5-FixkJF-2it4rec-CFtp3V-akdZ6d-bSfHUF-2hwYpCz-7vXhL6-QRVD6d-2kraYvE-2nVe76E-LLaiEf-L6zrJF-9DQXWJ-MdpFDY-8yZScx-6s18by-93Cfap-9sids1-wcY5gc-5Rjvgr-o4sBuM-2jjBPZ2-2jjyRZ7-9eFK5W-2kzRgEi-wcmf7J-253hAUw-vVxyBF-vfY9HY-aMibZV-vg5Wkr-vVnsqU-waHCjy-71erBQ-4N7xzo-wcYUe6-9mTKh9-wcjzfC-wcXPp8\" title=\"Schipa and wife, 1/15/25 (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50198949761_69744fff84_n.jpg\" width=\"224\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Schipa and wife, 1/15/25 (LOC)\" /></a>\nHis wife is Antoinette.

Lord Ashburton, whom Miss Belmont is to marry, Is a widower. His wife, a daughter of Viscount Hood, died a year ago last January. He Is the head of the famous London banking company of Baring.\nThe career of Miss Belmont reads like a fairy tale. She Is a New Yorker, though she was born In Ireland. Her first appearance on the stage was as one of the broom and mop girls In the chorus of &quot; Miladi.&quot;\n&quot; When Maggie Dolan scrubbed the floor\nYou can bet the floor was clean.&quot;\nMiss Belmont scrubbed as she sang In the chorus of twelve girls and she made such a hit that she soon had a chance to make an easier living by posing for art and fashion magazines. She found that there was more money and less work In allowing herself to be photographed than In the life of a chorus girl and she followed this for a little while until she, one day, reappeared on the stage in the Florodora sextet. At this time she was ambitious and asked for something better than the part of a &quot; Pretty Maiden.&quot; This did not fall In with the Idea of her managers, and she left &quot; Florodora.&quot;\n\nDetermination Wins High Place.\n\nHer next work was In the &quot;Toreador.&quot; She had a vaulting ambition, and in her Ideas of what part she would like to play, that of the leading woman In &quot;A Message from Mars &quot; took complete possession of her mind. One night Charles Hawtrey was In a box at the &quot; Toreador.&quot;\n&quot; Do you see that man over there?&quot; whispered Miss Belmont to the chorus girl next to her. &quot; That's Charles Hawtrey, the great English actor. I am going to get that man to give me a place In his company. You watch and see.&quot;\n\nThe next thing that happened was that the world of chorus girls, soubrettes, and managers was electrified to hear that Frances Belmont was engaged as the lending woman of Charles Hawtrey In &quot; A Message from Mars.&quot; How she met Mr. Hawtrey no one could learn. When asked as to how she got the engagement she answered;\n&quot; O, he just offered me the part and I accepted it.&quot;\n&quot; Had he ever seen you act?&quot;\n&quot; O, yes, I went down to a rehearsal and ran through a few roles for him one afternoon and he offered me the contract.&quot;\nManagers and every one who had seen Miss Belmont\njoined In the prediction that she would not &quot; make good.&quot;\n&quot; She has had no experience,&quot; said a well known manager.\n&quot; She can't even walk across the stage. I have a dozen girls In my chorus who could do as well as she can.&quot;\nThat this was all a matter of mere pique was seen when It resulted that Miss Belmont did make good. Now she has made good matrimonially also. Her home is in a little flat In New York with her mother and two sisters. They have even now gone across to be present at the wedding. Miss Belmont herself, however, who feels that her education has been deficient, is In a convent In Paris learning many things which will help to fit her for the high position which she will be called upon to fill.\n\n====","Thanks  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05], we'll add some of that info to the catalog record.","Bain did take a photo of her and Lord Ashburton together, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014719250/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014719250/</a>.","Francis Denzil Edward Baring, 5th Baron Ashburton (1866-1938)\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480720\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480720</a>\n\nFrances Donnelly (1885-1959), they married on 19 February 1906.\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q75355823\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q75355823</a>\n\nAs per above, Bain republished a 1906 image and filed it in with the 1926 tranche, instead of returning it to 1906.","Louis Lombard (1861-1927)\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61999453\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61999453</a>","See <a href=\"https://researchworks.oclc.org/archivegrid/collection/data/122613989\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">researchworks.oclc.org/archivegrid/collection/data/122613989</a> for the biography from his papers, held by the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University.\n\n&quot;Louis Lombard, a violinist, composer, and conductor who founded the Utica Conservatory of Music, was born in Lyon, France, in 1861. In 1870, Lombard's parents moved to Marseille, where he began taking classes in violin, solfeggio, and harmony of the National Conservatory of Music. In 1876 he visited the United States on a concert tour, returning to Paris in 1878 to continue his studies. He returned to the U.S. in 1879, traveling as a violin soloist and conductor. In 1886, H.C. Bunner, editor of Puck, wrote the libretto of a comic opera, to which Louis Lombard composed the music. In 1887 he again went abroad, traveling through seventeen countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. During this time, he studied eight languages and began to compose and conduct music. Upon his return to the United States in 1888, Lombard began his studies at the Columbia Law School. In February 1889, having proposed opening a conservatory of music in Utica, New York, he secured a large financial guarantee from 100 prominent families. He then gave up the study of law, and on September 2, 1889, opened the Utica Conservatory of Music with six professors and 186 students. Lombard's works have been published by C. Berdan, Oliver Ditson, Theodore Presser, and E.D. Buckingham. In 1900 he purchased a property in Switzerland where he kept an orchestra in residence, inviting prominent musicians to perform there. He conducted his personal orchestra as well as orchestras in New York, Paris, Milan, Berlin, Budapest, and Cairo. While living in Switzerland, he also composed and self-published music for orchestras, military bands, string quartets, and piano. From 1916 to 1920 he served as American Vice-Consul in both Zurich and Lugano.
