This from their website:\n&quot;THE UNITED STATES ARMY CANTONMENT AT CAMP DIX\nThe Camp Dix project, although one of Irwin &amp; Leighton’s earliest, stands\neven today as one of its most meaningful because of the signifi cance and\nimportance of the project to the World War I effort, and the speed in which it\nwas built.\nIrwin &amp; Leighton was chosen to build the Cantonment at Camp Dix when the\nsite’s installment began in 1917. The initial project was required to be completed\nunder a very aggressive time schedule to meet the impending demands of\nWorld War I. To do this, Irwin &amp; Leighton directly employed and/or coordinated\nthe efforts of hundreds of workers who, in accordance with the custom of the\nday, arrived at work in shirt and tie, changed into work clothes and changed\nagain to go home. Irwin &amp; Leighton established an onsite Employment Offi ce\nwhere seventeen clerks screened applicants who arrived by train and motor\ncar. A fl eet of autos was required to make the weekly commutes to the\nPhiladelphia National Bank for the workers’ payroll.\nThe project started in July of 1917, in farm\nfi elds. The scope involved ten sections of\nmultiple barracks and support buildings as\nwell as extensive infrastructure work. In less\nthan sixty days, the entire project was\nsubstantially complete. In that time, Irwin &amp; Leighton used forty million board feet of\nlumber, which was brought to the site by rail and erected in production fashion. When\nthe company hit stride, it was completing one barrack per day. Irwin &amp; Leighton’s onsite\nsuperintendent was E. M. Campbell. The company further organized the project with\n“Heads of Departments” for survey, concrete, carpentry, sheet metal, plumbing, electrical,\nroad construction, water and sewers, a pumping station, etc.\nThe 31,000 acre complex is located inside the Pineland National Reserve in Central New\nJersey, and was named for Major General John Adams Dix, a veteran of the War of 1812\nand the Civil War. Used as a staging ground and training area for units during World War I,\nit was made a permanent Army post in 1939 and was renamed as Fort Dix.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.irwinleighton.com/images/IL100Years\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.irwinleighton.com/images/IL100Years</a> C2.pdf","Now Ft.

His message was clear: the Netherlands had to take sides for the Allies and abandon its neutral stance. His graphic cartoons depicted the rule of the German military in Belgium, portrayed the Germans as barbarians and Kaiser Wilhelm II as an ally of Satan.&quot;\n\nHe visited the U.S. in 1917.  &quot;His tour was a triumph. Raemaekers gave lectures and interviews, drew caricatures for the movie cameras, was a popular guest at society functions, and met President Woodrow Wilson and former President Theodore Roosevelt. Soon after his arrival he signed – to everyone's surprise – a contract with the International News Service, the syndicate of William Randolph Hearst. The Hearst newspapers were viewed as pro-German and had been cut off from all Allied news sources. But Raemaekers' own theory: 'this is the most important target group because the readers are poisoned daily by tendentious articles' proofed [sic] successful.  Statistics show that by October 1917, more than two thousand American newspapers had published Raemaekers’ cartoons in hundreds of million copies.

Pershing (LOC)\" /></a>","B-59's link identifies the man at right as General Dubail, Military Governor of Paris.\n&quot;Auguste Yvon Edmond Dubail (15 April 1851 - 7 January 1934) was a French Army general. He commanded the First Army and Army Group East during World War I.\n[...]\nWhen the German offensive began at Verdun, Joffre partly blamed Dubail, who was fired in March 1916, publicly humiliated. He claimed to have been made a scapegoat for Joffre’s lack of foresight, although he had himself public played down the likelihood of a German attack at Verdun.[citation needed] Dubail was hired again and became military governor of Paris, a position he kept until the spring 1918, when he retired from public life. Dubail died in 1934, aged 82.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Dubail\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Dubail</a>","I think the person indentified as Dubail by the Ogden standard is not the same person. The uniform seems different. The man on the right in the Bain photo could be Dubail IMO (in this case the caption of the Ogden Standard was mistaken), or it's possibly Ferdinand Foch (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch</a>).\n\nPS: I came to the conclusion that the officer identified as Dubail by the Ogden standard is likely Foch.","You are probably right and this is a subject for further research. This 4th of July event in Paris in 1917 was copiously documented in photos and films, so hopefully some clearer photos than the one in the Ogden Standard will give an answer.","The sun., July 22, 1917, Section 4 Pictorial Magazine, Image 38 <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-07-22/ed-1/seq-38/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-07-22/ed-...</a> has photos of Gen. Pershing at the tomb of Lafayette and of Pershing with Gen. Dubail. The same photo, taken likely on July 4, 1917, in better qualitiy and with Gen. Foch on the left, ran in The Daily Ardmoreite., December 01, 1918, Image 11 <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042303/1918-12-01/ed-1/seq-11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042303/1918-12-01/ed-...</a>. Both French generals are wearing the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. Foch has a leather strap on his uniform, contrary to Dubail.\n\nI think therefore that the French general on the photo in The Ogden standard <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1917-07-25/ed-1/seq-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1917-07-25/ed-...</a> is indeed Foch.\n\nThe stripes on the pants and the boots suggest that the French general on the Bain photo is Dubail.","Thanks to both of you for teasing out the names of the others in this photograph.

The date of 5/10/27 is written on the Bain negative.  Princess Henriette was born in 1918. If the image was taken in 1931, she would have been about 13 years old. She looks younger to me, closer to the age she would have been in 1927 or earlier, about 9 years old.

His discovery, multiplexing, paved the way for the development of telephone and data networks; as did his later invention of sending music over electric wires.\n\nFirst Ph.D. in the Army\n\nSquier was born in Dryden, Mich., on March 21, 1865, and graduated from West Point military academy when he was 22. He was a rare intellect. He was accepted to Johns Hopkins University, and, in 1893, became the Army's first person to receive a doctorate.\n\nHe spent his career inventing and forging new structures in the U.S. Army.\n\nHis first invention, in 1896, with Albert Cushing Crehore, was a camera that measured the speed of warheads as they left the barrel of a cannon.\n\nPioneer of aeronautics\n\nSquier was assigned to the U.S. Signal Corps after the Spanish-American War, where he was responsible for creating the Aeronautical Division. He was the first Army officer to fly on an airplane, and, in 1909, was part of the team that bought the Army's first airplanes from the Wright brothers.\n\nThe aeronautics division was responsible for developing the communications and navigation equipment and procedures for military aircraft.\n\nIn 1910, while searching for ways to increase the number of calls Signal Corps could handle on its telephone network, Squier developed a way to multiplex calls, similar to how multiple signals could be bundled together on the telegraph network, called carrier frequency.\n\nHe was promoted to major general and chief signals officer for the Army during World War I, responsible for all communications and aviation during the war.\n\nIn 1919, he was elected to the National Academy of Science for his work in telephony, radio and aviation.\n\n'Grandfather of the Internet'\n\nBuilding on his multiplexing work, in 1922, Squier developed a system to &quot;pipe&quot; music using electric wires. He was granted a number of patents covering the delivery of music and other information over wires. His ideas are foundational to the concept of the Internet.\n\nHis Wired Radio Inc. became popular under the brand Muzak.\n\nSquier retired from the Army in 1924, and died in Washington on March 24, 1934.\n\nThe troop ship USS General G.O. Squier was named in his honor in 1943.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III at 615-881-7039, and on Twitter: @fdanielsiii.","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Owen_Squier\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Owen_Squier</a>","The Sunday Oregonian, July 29, 1917, SECTION FIVE, Image 67 published a cropped version of this photo with the caption:\n&quot;General George O.

Perhaps when this LOT was created, its makers took the  glass negative out of the Bain collection and physically moved it.  Another possibility is that a copy was made for the LOT, but the original negative left in the Bain collection was later lost or destroyed.\n\nThis happened to other photos in the Bain collection, like this shot of Helen Campbell, originally Bain 4204-12.\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b01181/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b01181/</a>\nand this subway-related shot, Bain 4377-14;\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007678625/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007678625/</a>\n\nBoth now cataloged in the LOT referenced above.\n\nThis certainly accounts for some of the many numbering gaps in the Bain collection.","Searching for &quot;photo by Bain News Service&quot; reveals 156 photos which are in other collections, some of which bear Bain catalog  numbers which are not their call numbers.\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Photo%20by%20Bain%20News%20Service%2C%20N.Y.C\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Photo%20by%20Bain%20News%2...</a>","Jane Lee (1912-17 March 1957) and her sister Katherine Lee (1909 - 1968) were child stars in silent motion pictures\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Lee\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Lee</a>\n\nS. also article  in The sun., June 24, 1917, Page 6, col. 2, 'POPULACE SPILLS HAZEL DAWN BEANS'\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-06-24/ed-1/seq-6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-06-24/ed-...</a>\n\nThe same event:\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/19237466493/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/19237466493/</a>","Thanks, B-59, we'll fix the Lee sisters.","And see:\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/19237474813/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Auto fashion parade (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/19237474813_53af0499b8_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"445\" alt=\"Auto fashion parade (LOC)\" /></a>","Flora Perini (20 November 1887 – September 1975), Italian operatic mezzo-soprano\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Perini\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Perini</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/16548822180/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/16548822180/</a>","Thanks, B-59, we can add full name here and elsewhere.","An ad for this event ran in the New York Sun on June 17, 1917:\n\n&quot;The Ultra Smart Event of the Season&quot;\n\nAUTOMOBILE FASHION SHOW\nON BEHALF OF THE ACTORS' FUND of AMERICA\n\nA brilliant assemblage of America's most beautiful\nwomen riding and driving in a glittering array of the\nmost up-to-date models of the Automobile \nManufacturers of the World.\n\nSHEEPSHEAD BAY SPEEDWAY\n$1 .00\nONE DAY ONLY \nSATURDAY, JUNE 23\n\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-06-17/ed-1/seq-24/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-06-17/ed-...</a>","Thanks for the information Art Siegel.

An oiran was trained in various traditional arts, including but not limited to classical dance, playing musical instruments and calligraphy. In addition, she would also be available for sex. The profession no longer exist and nowadays only actresses wear these costumes.\n\nGeisha do not offer sex. The name of their profession betrays their occupation as a &quot;person of art&quot;. They are professional dancers and musicians, just like the oiran, but without the sexual part and in different styles of art. That's not to say there was never sex involved between a geisha and her customer, but it was not a requirement of the profession. \n\nLastly, the term &quot;geisha girl&quot; was given after World War II by American GI's stationed in Japan, who were looking for prostitutes whom they called &quot;geisha girls&quot;. Even less information than today was available about the geisha back then, and to hear of women providing service to entertain men... they just drew the wrong conclusion. Some women used that misconception to their benefit and as such, the term &quot;geisha girl&quot; and its matching misunderstanding was born.","Did this profession disappear before, or after the Japanese defeat in World War Two?","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/118353874@N05] Prostitution was made illegal in 1958, so that is when the profession of the oiran officially ended.

The aviator never ever wore a mustache.  He was tall and very skinny.\nFrom a military point of view, he wore 3 “chevron” in his sleeves: a Captain.\nThe other aviators who went with him to the US to train the first US air corps were all lieutenants with 2 chevrons on their sleeves.\nI was personally in touch with descendants of some of the other pilots and the family of Gautier is sure it is their grd father.

The road is higher than the ground to the left (north) of it, and that valley was called Mash Valley. To the right (or south) of la Boiselle is another valley called Sausage valley. The latter may have been named after a German observation balloon (or 'sauasage') which flew there, although there are also suggestions that the appearance of the contour lines on the map led to the name. After Sausage Valley was named, it was perhaps inevitable that the valley to its north would be named 'Mash'!&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/laboiselle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/laboiselle.html</a>","About Brooks:\n&quot;Ernest Brooks (23 February 1878 — after 1936) was a British photographer, best known for his war photography from the First World War.

First place must be given of course to the 150 ton revolving derrick Hercules. The derrick jib is capable of having its outer end raised or lowered thus giving to the hoisting blocks which depend vertically therefrom a movement of rotation about the center of the derrick, and also one of translation in and out from the center.  With the outer end of the jib in its lowest position the hoisting blocks will, on rotation of the derrick, describe the circumference of a circle 207 feet in diameter;  with the jib in its highest position the diameter of the circle described is 88 feet.  Thus the derrick may operate on weights lying anywhere between these two circles as boundaries.  The maximum load of 150 tons can be handled only within a ring the maximum and minimum diameters of which are 147 and 88 feet respectively,  but weights not exceeding 70 tons may be handled throughout the entire field of operations.  The maximum elevations above mean high water,, for the hoisting blocks, are 118 and 69 feet respectively in the high and lower positions of the jib.  The derrick is revolved by duplicate sets of machinery. \n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Eb1MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;lpg=PA501&amp;dq=hercules+newport+news+crane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YvuH3-DSUd&amp;sig=0N50VaLtoSW3h_ZiAK8B_D1BWls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qLIpVZK7BpCIoQSAmoC4Bw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hercules%20newport%20news%20crane&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=Eb1MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;l...</a>","This picture ran in the New York Tribune Review in April, 1918, attributed to Underwood &amp; Underwood.\n<a href=\"http://navsource.org/archives/01/pdf/012746.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">navsource.org/archives/01/pdf/012746.pdf</a>\nAn online source (probably thinking the photo dated from April, 1918, guesses at the ship involved.\n&quot;Assuming this photograph wasn't aging in a camera somewhere, the mast most likely belongs to the Michigan (BB-27).

Soldiers and workers set up the &quot;Petrograd Soviet&quot; of 2,500 elected deputies while the Duma declared a Provisional Government on 13 March. Alexander Kerensky was a key player in the new regime. The Duma informed the tsar that day that he must abdicate.\n\nIn an effort to put an end to the uprising in the capital, Nicholas tried to get to St Petersburg by train from army headquarters at Mogiliev. The route was blocked so he tried another way. His train was stopped at Pskov where, after receiving advice from his generals, he first abdicated the throne for himself and later, on seeking medical advice, for himself and his son the tsarevich Alexei.  Alexandra was now in a perilous position as the wife of the deposed tsar, hated by the Russian people. Nicholas finally was allowed to return to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo where he was placed under arrest with his family. Despite the fact he was a first cousin of both Nicholas and Alexandra, George V refused to allow them to evacuate to the United Kingdom, as he was alarmed by their unpopularity in his country and the potential repercussions to his own throne.&quot;","Thanks to all of you for this fabulous research.

Brewster, 310 Washington avenue, is a young artist who\nrecently joined the Washington Square colony. He was for more than three years court painter to the Royal Family of Italy. As a boy he started art work in the Florentine Royal Academy of Art and at 13 was graduated into the nude school, thereafter studying under his father, Arnaldo Tamburini, court  painter for King Humbert and Queen Margharita. Count Tamburini won his first prize in portrait painting at a national exhibition in Florence with a portrait of his mother. King Vittorio Emmanuele then made him court painter. Among portraits of the King of Italy that he painted were those presented to the Shah of Persia, to the Emperor of Japan and to the French Government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Italian independence.\n\nSince coming to America Count Tamburini painted a portrait of Cardinal Farley and also large compositions among the steel workers of Pittsburg. They are on exhibition in the Florentine Royal Academy. He does not look for a boom in European art immediately following the war. If it had been a short war of quick conquest he believes that the pictorial art would have received a decided impetus. He believes, however, that a new school of art will spring up in Italy after the war, an art in which the common people will express their voices.&quot;\n\nCount Tamburini's informant in Italy tells him that Germany has sent a commission into Northern Italy with the ostensible purpose of protecting art treasures in Venice, but, as a matter of fact, the art body as well as the army believes that Germans invaded Italy for the purpose of confiscation, as they have done in Belgium, and that, should they gain Venice, it will be despoiled of its treasures. Hence the implacable hate that is now making the Italians fight so courageously. &quot;\n<a href=\"http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper 5/Brooklyn NY Daily Eagle/Brooklyn NY Daily Eagle 1918 Grayscale/Brooklyn NY Daily Eagle 1918 Grayscale - 0506.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%205/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20E...</a>\n\nA self portrait:\n<a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/arnaldo-casella-tamburini-jr/self-portrait-qPKIcZk6Ond4UzR4JknfvA2\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.artnet.com/artists/arnaldo-casella-tamburini-jr/self-...</a>","Another biographical sketch (though the painting accompanying it appears to be by his father):\n\n&quot;Count Tamburini was born of noble birth in Florence, Italy in 1885. At the age of fifteen he won a national art contest and Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, commissioned him to paint his portrait. The young artist was following in his father's footsteps as court painter to the Italian throne.\n \nHe became an artist of international acclaim and in 1901 set out for Canada to paint the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfred Laurier. The following year he traveled to America to paint the Archbishop of New York.\n \nThese journeys started a lifetime of travel, painting some of world's most illustrious people of the time, including Queen Marie of Romania and Czar Nicholas II and his family.\n \nTamburini married miniature painter Dolores Dolja Dunifer in 1914 and the young couple settled in New York, although they continued to travel extensively. Tamburini himself died from an accidental death in 1936.\n \nAs well as portraits, Tamburini painted allegorical compositions and landscapes.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mylearning.org/portraits/p-601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mylearning.org/portraits/p-601/</a>","In 1928, an Australian newspaper account as he and his wife arrived there (they arrived in July, 1928):\n&quot;\nCOUNT TAMBURINI.    \nA COURT PAINTER.\nARRIVES WITH PORTRAIT OF\nTHE POPE.\nThe portrait of the Pope, which will be\nan important accessory in ceremonies at the\nEucharistic Congress, arrived in Sydney last\nnight by the steamer Aorangi.

Being previously engaged upon the\nportraits of the Pope Pius XI, at the Sistlne\nChapel in Rome, this world-famed artist\ngained the appreciation of the Holy Father\non his results. So, with the sanction and\ncommendation of the Vatican, two remarkable\nportraits were brought to Sydney. Unfor-\ntunately the Customs officials intervened, and\nthus only the smaller portrait of the Pope\nwas placed at St. Mary's Cathedral during\nthe Eucharistic Congress. Much interest was\naroused, as the likeness was wonderful. As-\ntonishing also was the fact that the artist\nhad gained his place at the early age of 13,\nin the Art Academy of Italy. Then his por-\ntrait of his beautiful mother was considered\nremarkable. So the heritage of fourteen cen-\nturies of art was handed down.\nThe Countess Casella, Timburini's mother.\nis a very talented musician. She also com-\nposes. It was naturally an experiment when\nher eldest son brought to the ancient palace\nIn Floronce an American wife, who regarded\nwith wide-open eyes the famous carvings\nand antiques of one of the oldest Roman\nfamilies. The young wife shivered as she\nwalked over the wnite marble floors and peep-\ned through a vista of spacious reception\nrooms. Musty with age, and crumbling in\ntheir cellars amongst the old vintages, the\nnew Countess unlocked coffers full of won-\ndrous Persian shawls of Paisley design, which\nbore the names of the artists of a bygone age.\nPicture the dismay of the old Countess Tam-\nburini when she learned that cables to the\nUnited States had been sent to bring over\nmodern lighting equipment and steam heat\nfor their sumptuous hut chilly surround-\nings. It was thus that old Rome awakened\nto the advent of the modern school. It was\nnot an easy task to reconstruct a Roman\nhousehold, but the experiment was-successful\nfor all parties.\nINDUSTRY COUNTS.\nIndustry counts iIn Italy, and both the Count\nand Countess Tamburini have never a mo-\nment to spare. They live every minute. As\na relaxation from the easel the Count likes\nto ride to hounds, or have a game of ten-\nnis, or go swimming. Then the Countess\npacks up her tubes of oils, and wanders forth\nto a public hospital, where she seeks out\nsome cripple. She answers to the name of\nDolia, and likes to read some good story\nto a bed-weary patient. She is always en-    \ndeavouring to do someone a good turn in a\nquiet way. Both these modest and really\nhumble, personages of the nobility stroll\nforth around the city, and learn much of\nour mode of living. &quot;Some years ago now,&quot;\nthe Countess said, &quot;we decided to settle down\nin an apartment house in New York, so we\ntransplanted many of our antiques to the mod-\nern dwelling. Massive furnishings and rare\nold brocades were taken over, and these, with\nthe old wood carvings over the doors, so\nfascinated the elite of New York that studio\nparties became a craze. I had just finished a\ndelightful miniature of my husband on ivory,\nwhich was drying in the studio, when some\nof our visitors took a fancy to it, and it\ndisappeared; so did my jewels, and finally\nthat settled our New York domicile. We\npacked up and wandered forth to Boston,\nwhere Mr. Clarence W. Barron, of the 'Bos-\nton News,' and the 'Boston Weekly,' placed\nhis town house and yacht at our disposal.\n&quot;It was whilst aboard the boat that the\nbusy man sat for his painting, which was\ngreatly prized. Also so many interesting people\nwho were his guests desired to be painted.\nSignora Galli Curci and her husband were\nguests at the same house party, and we had\nthe best of music. As Count Tamburini plays\nand sings he adds gaiety to every party. I\nhave to drive him sometimes to settle down\nto his painting, because the society beauties\nof the old and new world lure him from his\nart. But when Arnaldo Tamburini decides\nto make a masterpiece he excludes himself\nfrom everyone.\n&quot;Sometimes six months elapse and when\nhe returns from his exclusion I can see by\nhis face that he has achieved something that\nhas given him the necessary satisfaction. Then\nhe is loth to sell his work. It was thus, when\nin such a mood, he painted Mussolini. Never\nhad that untiring leader even been photo-\ngraphed. Count Tamburini was insistent up-\non permission to observe him in his study,\nintense with the emotion of a great resolve.\nSo the artist made his portrait in oils, and\nthat picture now hangs in a room to itself\nat the famous Academy of Arts In New York,\nWhere Sir Joseph Devine has an unwritten\nlaw that only the old masters can adorn his\nwalls. This is in itself an achievement for\na comparatively young man.&quot;\nIntensely proud is the beautiful Countess.\nShe comes from an old South American fam-\nily, and studied art as a girl. She thus is at\none with her husband, and has the same\nideals. They both treasure antiques. They\ndelight in colour. Each vies with the other\nin love of the tones of deepest tangerine\nand yellow; but neither shows the other\nany work until it is completed.\nKEEN DISAPPOINTMENT.            \nIt was a keen disappointment to them to\narrive in Sydney and find that our Customs\nauthorities made an exhibition prohibitive.    \nIt was Count Tamburini's desire to exhibit\non a grand scale. That would have meant\ndistributing many thousands of pounds in ad-\nvertising; and there would have been other\nexpenses. &quot;Why cannot Australia adopt the\nAmerican law? What I desire to say,&quot; urged\nthe Count, &quot;to those interested in art here\nin Australia is that if a foreign artist could\nbring in works of art duty free for just\none year for exhibition purposes, how much\nmore interesting it would be. There would\nbe a better incentive for artists, and the pub-\nlic would gain more in knowledge.&quot;\n&quot;What we find lacking in Sydney,&quot; the\nCountess continued, &quot;Is the right type of\napartment houses. Here we paid more than\nin New York for a flat where comparisons\nwere against it in every requisite. That is\nnot agreeable for tourists. We came\nwith the intention of staying here a long\nperiod. We proposed also to ask some of\nour very distinguished friends to join us. But\nthe high rents, the cost of living, and\nthe excessive duty on our portraits, which\nare essential for us to have with us always,\nsettled the matter. We do not consider it\nadvisable to remain here very much longer\nunless, of course, the law changes, and our\ngoods and chattels can come in at less cost.&quot;\n'We have no quarrel with a Government  \nthat excludes commodities that can be pro-\ncured here. But what have you in the\nway of antiques? One frame on the portraits\nwe brought into Sydney cannot be priced.\nIt is so old, and so very valuable. Why\nexclude a curiosity?\n&quot;Our desire, &quot; added the Count, &quot;was to\nmake the most of everything and enjoy the\ngreat hospitality that every one bestows on\nstrangers here But when I came, nearly\ntwo months were wasted on tie doorsteps\nof the Government officials, awaiting their\nedict about my paintings. It is all very\ndisheartening for a hard-working artist. When\nI decide to paint a portrait, I never know\nhow long it will take me. I may achieve\nmy ideal in one hour. Another sitter may\ntake me months of really hard work. It\nis a joy to dabble with my colours. I favour\nyellow tones.\n&quot;When the ex-Queen Marie of Roumania\ndecided that I should paint her portrait we\nwere at sea. The ship rolled and tossed,\nand how we all enjoyed searching for my\ntubes of colour. That painting was sold to\nbenefit the poor children of Roumania. &quot;\nThe physology of art is in itself a great\nstudy, and both the Count and Countess\nTimburini have the inborn love for humanity\nthat expresses itself in their studies. Each  \nmake a point of achieving what they desire.\nTheir determination and self-denial are very\nremarkable\nOpals are the delight of the Countess, whose\ndesire it is to see the opal fields here. The\ncount loves to cook a meal while his beautiful\nwife remakes a Paris gown. She enjoys a good\nday's sewing and has that artistry of line\nwhich astounds even the friends who know\nshe sews for pastime. But it takes such  \nan enthusiastic wife to urge such a man\nto do still better things for art. To them\nmoney means nothing. They have always\nhad means to study, and to linger where\nand when they desired. No greater portrait\npainter lives to-day that Count Tamburlini.\nSargent he considered was the world's greatest.\nHe does not boast, he enjoys his fame. He\nknows his worth to the art world. Tamburlini\nat the moment is painting at the sheep-shear-\ning sheds in Victoria, ere leaving for the\nUnited States. There the newly-elected Presi-\ndent will sit for his portrait. That is their \nlife, and they enjoy it.&quot;\nThe Sydney Morning Herald Saturday 1 December 1928\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16513415#pstart1198878\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16513415#pstart1198878</a>","The Count was still  in Australia in January, 1929 and there is a lengthy illustrated interview with him from the Melbourne Advocate:\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/171654702\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/171654702</a>","<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/16253648923\" title=\"Enrolling for War at Suffrage H'dqr's.

Ferris was a poor man who hoped to wed the daughter of a wealthy local squire. In order to win her hand, he planned to set sail from Whitby to make his fortune. On the night that he left, the Esk was swollen with rainfall and he was unable to make a last visit to his intended. He eventually returned from his travels a rich man and, after marrying the squire's daughter, built Beggar's Bridge so that no other lovers would be separated as they were.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaisdale\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaisdale</a>\n\nIt is a Grade II listed structure:\n&quot;Bridge, 1619 dated with arms of Thomas Ferris of Hull who built it. Roughly-coursed large sandstone. Single deep segmental arch with voussoirs and arch ring. Peaked parapet, with chamfered coping, over arch only. Paved roadway, between coped abutments at either side, 6½ feet wide.\nJervoise op.cit. p.63.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-327998-beggars-bridge-over-river-esk-egton-nort\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-327998-beggars-bridge...</a>\n\nAnother account of the Beggar's Bridge story:\n&quot;Also at the bottom of the village, the much photographed Beggar’s Bridge over the River Esk is an ancient pack horse bridge.  Legend says it was built in 1619 by Tom Ferris.  When he was but a poor local lad, he had to wade or swim the river to court his love, the daughter of a farmer who lived on the opposite bank.  When leaving the village to seek his fame and fortune, the river was in full spate so he was unable to cross to bid her goodbye.  He did make his fortune, eventually becoming Lord Mayor of Hull and Master of Trinity House, but never forgot his true love in Glaisdale and built the bridge in her memory.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.visitwhitby.com/tourist-information/people-places/inland-villages\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.visitwhitby.com/tourist-information/people-places/inl...</a>","Street View 2011: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@54.438863,-0.792096,3a,75y,180.08h,83.93t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sdE3rM_olVJ67mg18qBuTzQ!2e0\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.google.com/maps/@54.438863,-0.792096,3a,75y,180.08h,8...</a>","Thanks for finding more information and providing the links.

By JB Pearce after a competition. Red brick laid in Flemish bond and with terracotta details and sandstone dressings. Slate roofs. Built round a narrow courtyard. Queen Anne style. EXTERIOR: 2 storeys rising to 3 in the tower. Asymmetrical entrance front to the north-west. 7-window range. Rusticated ground floor and string courses between the floors. To the left are 3 bays of cross casements fitted with plate-glass horned sashes. The first-floor windows have 2 transoms. Small pediments in the balustraded parapet. These bays have paired pilasters right and left. The centre bay has one 3-light cross casement (with sashes) to each of its 3 floors. The right-hand 3 bays contain the round-arched principal entrance and two 2-light cross casements as before. Paired pilasters separate the first-floor cross casements which have the double transoms and now round heads. Swags in the parapet. A tower, square on plan, rises through 2 storeys to an ogeed lantern: open round arches over clock faces; glazed lantern. The south-west facade faces the river: symmetrical; 8 bays plus closing bays right and left. Cross casements fitted with sashes as before. Garlanded parapet and central segmental pediment. Hipped roofs with flat. INTERIOR: the entrance hall has pairs of panelled baluster piers on high plinths alternating with single piers running down the centre and attached as pilasters to the walls. Modified Ionic capitals. An Imperial staircase rises to the east: open string, twisted balusters over vases, moulded handrail. Pairs of painted glass windows light the stairs from a small internal courtyard. The whole of the west side of the first floor is given over to a ceremonial hall of 9 by 3 bays, the bays divided by fluted pilasters. The north wall has paired fluted columns and pilasters, the south wall has Corinthian columns set in front of pilasters. Heavy modillion cornice with leaf-trail decoration and deep coving below a barrel-vaulted roof with eared and shouldered raised panels. The south-east corner of the first floor was used until 1990 as a magistrates court with a complete set of fittings from 1882. Panelled bench and dock, the latter with an internal staircase dropping to a secure room and side entrance on the ground floor. The council chamber has a canopy at the west end and a gallery at the east end. &quot;\n<a href=\"http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1246969\" rel=\"nofollow\">list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1246969</a>\n\nFull restoration in 2008:\n<a href=\"http://archiseek.com/2009/1878-municipal-buildings-great-yarmouth-norfolk/#.UP21Sx3tSqg\" rel=\"nofollow\">archiseek.com/2009/1878-municipal-buildings-great-yarmout...</a>\n\n2012 Google Street View:\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@52.606173,1.724362,3a,75y,118.9h,100.65t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sMKfsI7lZhH_OB5FddCEz7g!2e0\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.google.com/maps/@52.606173,1.724362,3a,75y,118.9h,100...</a>","art siegel: thanks for finding more information about the Town Hall.

The claim that this is the location of his death appears to date from no earlier than a 17th-century visit by Charles II to the forest. At the time the most popular account of William's death involved the fatal arrow deflecting off a tree, and Charles II appears to have been shown a suitable tree. Letters in The Gentleman's Magazine reported that the tree was cut down and burned during the 18th century. Later in that century the Rufus stone was set up. Originally it was around 5 feet 10 inches tall (1.78 m) with a stone ball on top. King George III visited the stone in 1789, along with his queen, and an inscription was added to the stone to commemorate the visit. It was protected with a cast iron cover in 1841 after repeated vandalism.\n\nThe inscription on the Rufus Stone reads:\n\nHere stood the oak tree, on which an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell at a stag, glanced and struck King William the Second, surnamed Rufus, on the breast, of which he instantly died, on the second day of August, anno 1100.\nKing William the Second, surnamed Rufus, being slain, as before related, was laid in a cart, belonging to one Purkis and drawn from hence, to Winchester, and buried in the Cathedral Church, of that city.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_England#The_Rufus_Stone\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_England#The_Rufus_Stone</a>\n\nGoogle Street View, 2011:\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@50.911403,-1.616883,3a,75y,215.68h,73.78t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1saBaqm8vhvthYvvNhtw6Wjg!2e0?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.google.com/maps/@50.911403,-1.616883,3a,75y,215.68h,7...</a>","art siegel: thanks for finding more information about the Rufus Stone.

He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, and obtained a position at the Ministry of Finance.[1] In 1915, he rose to the position of director of the Bank of Chosen. [2] He was appointed Finance Minister under the Terauchi[3] and Kiyoura administrations, [4] and Education Minister under the Tanaka administration. In 1938, he was considered for the post of Home Minister under the 2nd Konoe administration, a somewhat surprising choice, given his age and lack of experience in the Home Ministry, and the nomination was rejected by Emperor Hirohito.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazue_Sh%C5%8Dda\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazue_Sh%C5%8Dda</a>","Art Siegel: thanks for finding more information on Mr. Shoda.

It will he remembered that she came to this Country in an official capacity as she was sponsored by the French Government and her mission was to bring to us the highest and finest kind of French vocal art and to set before us the best examples of the French school of song composition.  The success of Mme Gills in America was instantaneous and led to keen competition among the managers for the securing of her services after the expiration of her governmental work. Kingsbery Foster was the successful impresario who succeeded in contracting Mme Gills tor a 1918 19 tour of concerts in this country. While patriotic in purpose the Gills appearances last year quickly lost that aspect after the public and the critics had become acquainted with her marvelous art in vocal modulation, diction, and before all things in intelligent and soulful interpretation.  It was seen at once that here one had to do with an artist of phenomenal attainments and thereafter ovations extended to her were in the nature of tributes to an artist of genius rather than outbursts of patriotism designed to be complimentary to our French Allies. The chief beauty of Mme Gills art lies in the fact that she is not a vocal virtuosa. \nThat gushing account:\n&quot;Although she knows all the needs and duties of the singing art and science she does not aim to astonish by the display of throat fireworks and she does not seek sensationalistic effects by confining her repertoire to The Marseillaise, Carillon and similar songs whose chief appeal aside from their intrinsic worth lies of course in their patriotic purport. On the contrary, Mme Gills reaches the hearts of her listeners through a repertoire, a method and an interpretation of the most elevated artistic kind and her main triumphs have been achieved in her renderings of the song classics in the French vocal literature, both ancient  modern.\nIt is a study in sublimated vocal art to note how Gills dissects a song into its component parts and makes a perfect presentation of each phase of the composition,  musical and literary.  In dramatic intensity, in projection, and in soulfulness and in keen sense of proportion and climax no song singer before the public  today is more thoroughly effective than Gabrielle Gills.  It was no matter for surprise to her American admirers that she was selected in Paris to be the soloist on the occasion of the funeral services of the late Claude Debussy.  Mme Gills' tour in the United States will commence next fall and Kingsbury Foster reports that he has had only the success he expected in a magnificently large number of concerts for the French songstress .&quot;","There is very little biographical information on her online after her U.S. appearances around WWI.

Her stay was intended to be brief, but the acclaim she received for her performance as Gilda in Rigoletto in Chicago, Illinois on 18 November 1916 (her 34th birthday) was so wildly enthusiastic that she accepted an offer to remain with the Chicago Opera Company.

Could this photo have been taken when that station was being extended by volunteers?\n\nFrom a blog post about the new station opened in 2008: <a href=\"http://arlingtonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/04/new-fire-station.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">arlingtonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/04/new-fire-statio...</a>\n  &quot;The original Company No. 5 was organized on Dec. 17, 1926, when the County Board of Alexandria County - as Arlington was then known - approved the charter of the Jefferson District Volunteer Fire Department.\n  The original company listed seven firefighters on its rolls and operated from a member’s garage at 206 Frazier Avenue - now 23rd Street South - in Aurora Hills.\n  In 1928, the volunteers opened a station at 101 Frazier Ave. (With the adoption of a new street naming scheme, the station was addressed 501 South 23rd St.).&quot;\n\nThis all seems consistent with this being the station at 101 Frazier Ave (later 501 South 23rd St) during 1927/28  -- but not totally definitive.","Nice detective work swanq. I think you're right, this appears to be the Jefferson District station in Arlington, VA. I searched some newspapers databases to see if I could find a related story but I didn't have any luck. The closest thing I found was an article in the May 18, 1928 issue of the Washington Post which mentioned a celebration for the the opening of the Jefferson fire station. State Senator Frank Ball said &quot;...I would fall far short did I not say that success only followed with the loyal and hearty support of the women of the auxiliary who have worked day and night in the interest of the department.&quot; \n\nWe'll add this information to the catalog record.","Thanks for adding to the Astonishing Power of Flickr group","We recently found some old catalog cards for Harris &amp; Ewing that had a caption for this photo.

She began her career in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century singing coloratura soprano roles. Early on in her career her voice darkened and dropped slightly causing her to focus more within the mezzo-soprano repertoire while still singing some soprano roles. She joined the Metropolitan Opera company in 1907 where she performed regularly in mostly supporting roles until her retirement in 1922. She is best remembered today for portraying the role of the Abbess in the original production of Puccini's Suor Angelica in 1918.&quot;","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Blanton\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Blanton</a>\n&quot;Thomas Lindsay Blanton (October 25, 1872 – August 11, 1957) was a United States Representative from Texas.

The physical training department of Wellesley College has taken up the whole question of female beauty in a serious way and is rapidly reducing the measurement and classification of the female form divine to an exact science. The latest step forward in the science is the invention by Henry M. Austin of Wellesley of the thoracimeter.

Her father loved the cloth that she wove and so she worked very hard every day to weave it. However, Orihime was sad that because of her hard work she could never meet and fall in love with anyone. Concerned about his daughter, Tentei arranged for her to meet Hikoboshi (彦星 Cow Herder Star?) (also referred to as Kengyuu (牽牛?)) who lived and worked on the other side of the Amanogawa. When the two met, they fell instantly in love with each other and married shortly thereafter. However, once married, Orihime no longer would weave cloth for Tentei and Hikoboshi allowed his cows to stray all over Heaven. In anger, Tentei separated the two lovers across the Amanogawa and forbade them to meet. Orihime became despondent at the loss of her husband and asked her father to let them meet again. Tentei was moved by his daughter’s tears and allowed the two to meet on the 7th day of the 7th month if she worked hard and finished her weaving. The first time they tried to meet, however, they found that they could not cross the river because there was no bridge. Orihime cried so much that a flock of magpies came and promised to make a bridge with their wings so that she could cross the river. It is said that if it rains on Tanabata, the magpies cannot come and the two lovers must wait until another year to meet. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata</a>","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_festivals\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_festivals</a>\nMatsuri (祭?) is the Japanese word for a festival or holiday. \n\nThere is a Chinese version of the legend and festival too.

Born Wilfrid Douthitt in 1888 in London, he trained there under the well known Welsh soprano, Clara Novello-Davies (1861-1943), who later moved to New York. She was the mother of the stage and screen personality Ivor Novello (1893-1951). Douthitt first studied architecture at the Royal College of Art, South Kensington. He made his New York debut in 1914 in an operetta called The Lilac Domino, opposite Eleanor Painter, and received enthusiastic notices. In 1915, a baritone resembling Douthitt but called Louis Graveure made his New York recital debut. The press was curious to know if Graveure was, in fact, Douthitt. Even after a member of the press knocked on Graveure's apartment door, held up a photograph for comparison, and pronounced that, without the camouflage of his recently grown goatee, Douthitt and Graveure were the same singer, Graveure denied it emphatically. He proclaimed himself Belgian. Thus began one of the better promotional strategies of the twentieth century.

Under the age of 21, which disqualified him from automatic acceptance into the armed forces, twice Darcy attempted to enlist, but his mother Margaret refused to give her written consent.\n\nAs more Australians lost their lives in World War I, Darcy continued his boxing career, but came under greater scrutiny from his critics. While conscription was still optional, the Australian government prevented Darcy from legally leaving the country to travel to fight in America.\n\nOn 19 February 1916, Darcy knocked out Harold Hardwick in seven rounds to win the Australian heavyweight title. His final fight in Australia was on 30 September 1916, when he knocked out George Chip in nine rounds.\n\nTwo days before his 21st birthday on 29 October 1916, Darcy stowed away on an ocean steamer bound for the USA and arrived in New York six weeks later. He was publicly portrayed as a coward by his critics in both Australia and America.\n\nAfter Darcy took the oath of allegiance to become an American citizen and joined the American Air Force, promoters arranged his first foreign fight in the USA to be held on 7 May 1917.\n\nWhilst training for his American debut, Darcy collapsed on 27 April 1917.
