Although privately &amp; voluntarily run by a small group of Australian women, it operated in connection with the military hospital at Val de Grace under the auspices of the French Military Authorities, and catered to French wounded. Established in July 1915, it was later either closed, or taken over by the French authorities in January 1916.\nThe founders were Mrs Smith (wife of Colonel William Smith, AAMC – of Sth Yarra), together with her 2 daughters Alison &amp; Lorna (who were talented cooks); Mrs Blackwood (wife of Robert O. Blackwood); &amp; of course Dr Helen Sexton. The 2 trained nursing staff working with them were Florence Lilian Inglis (later AVH &amp; QAIMNSR) &amp; Dora Wilson (both having trained at Prince Alfred Hosp, Sydney). [Audrey &amp; Eileen Chomley may have also worked there]\nFrom what I've read, Dr Sexton was the only female doctor involved in the hospital, although there were a few male consulting physicians.\nThe address of the hospital was: Hospital Australien de Paris (Complimentaire da Val de Grace, V.G., 81), 46 Rue du Docteur Blanche, Auteuil, Paris.\nAfter leaving the Hospital Australien in Jan 1916, Dr Sexton &amp; Mrs Blackwood took up positions at the Buffon Military Hospital – a large French military hospital, also in Paris.&quot;\n\nMore info, with citations, at:\n<a href=\"http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/198004-field-hospital-at-auteuil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/198004...</a>","A photo of the entire hospital compound, with the Eiffel Tower in the background:\n<a href=\"http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/fieldoperations/ch10fig53.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/fieldoperations/ch10...</a>","Art Siegel:  Thanks for the background information on the Auteuil hospital.

Gorner, 1916 Penn street, is the latest \nHarrisburg boy to die in France fighting for world democracy.\n  A telegram from the War Department, received by his wife, Mrs. Lorena Gorner, brought to Harrisburg the news that he had made the supreme sacrifice and the information also was contained in the Government's official casualty list published this morning.  The casualty list stated merely that he had been &quot;killed in action&quot; in France.\n  Gorner, who volunteered and enlisted at the Harrisburg Army Recruiting Station, 325 Market street, just one year ago this month, was placed in the Fourth Infantry.  That is one of the old regiments of the Regular Army and was in camp at Gettysburg at that time.  Because of its having been one of the units established before the war, the Fourth had but few vacancies to fill and Gorner was assigned to one of these. \n  \nWhile it was known at the local recruiting station that the Fourth had arrived in England a number of weeks ago the news of Corporal Gorner's death brought the first intimation received here that the Fourth had subsequently not only reached French soil but evidently had seen action on the firing line.  It was stated at the recruiting station, however, that the Fourth, being one of the old regiments of regulars, was well trained and equipped to be put right into the fighting. \n\n  Mrs. Gorner resides at the Penn street address with Mrs. J. H. Keezy.  She and her husband lived there before his enlistment.  The notice from Washington came as a terrific shock to the widow, particularly as Corporal Gorner has been abroad less than two months.    After being assigned to Company A, 4th Infantry, stationed at Gettysburg, Gorner and his unit were transferred to Camp Greene, Charlotte, North Carolina.  About May 1 he sailed with his division to England from Newport News.\n\n  Gorner who was 32 years old, was a son of Mr. and Mrs. George Gorner, of Marietta.  There he lived until his marriage, when he and his wife moved to 1916 Penn street, this city, where they boarded with Mrs. Keezy.  Previous to his enlistment, the Corporal was employed as a brakeman on the Philadelphia Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\n  The young soldier who has met death was a brother of Frank Gorner, to whom was awarded a medal for bravery last Decoration Day on account of his having saved several persons from drowning in the Susquehanna River.\n\n  Corporal Gorner is survived by his wife, parents and one brother. \n\nWidow Prostrated by News of Gorner's Death\n\n  When the news of the death of Corporal W. O. Gorner, who was killed while fighting Huns in France, reached Mrs. Gorner late last evening she was prostrated and up until a late hour today was still confined to her bed.  Her condition however, is not considered alarming.\n\n  Although Mrs. Gorner was not able to be seen by a reporter, her sister said that as soon as the first shock of the news passed, the widow declared she was proud that her husband had died in the service of his Country. &quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/dauphin/newspapers/en-1918-7-11.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">files.usgwarchives.net/pa/dauphin/newspapers/en-1918-7-11...</a>","More at <a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Gorner&amp;GSfn=William&amp;GSmn=O.&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=125386456&amp;df=all&amp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Gorner...</a>;","Art Siegel:  Thanks for finding the article on Gorner's death.

It was a mistake. Mr Sharkey had a boy abroad in the army and volunteered with all good intentions feeling that his athletic ability might be used in the service. It was impossible however as his life long connections with the ring,  the saloon,  and the dive and the police courts could not justify the committee accepting him.  A wide publicity had been given however to his application and an over eager press agent had borrowed an Association suit and cap and had him photographed and statements sent abroad that he was going under the Association auspices.&quot;\nand elsewhere:\n&quot;Tom Sharkey was not accepted for overseas service.

The village was situated on high ground surrounded by woods, making it an ideal target for German artillery.\n  Aiding the capture, the French provided air cover, 368 heavy guns, trench mortars, tanks, and flamethrowers.

Cantigny is a small village north of Paris, in the Picardy region of France. Held by the German Army, Cantigny formed a dangerous salient in the Allied lines. On May 28, 1918, the First Division attacked and defeated the German forces in the village and held it against repeated German counterattacks, despite suffering more than 1,000 casualties. The success raised the Allies’ morale, convinced the British and French that the Americans were capable of operating in independent fighting units, and disproved German propaganda about American incapacity. Cantigny also was the first significant use of modern, combined arms operations by the US Army. The division was supported by French air units, flame thrower teams, tanks and artillery. After the Battle of Cantigny, the First Division participated in the major battles of Soissons, St. Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne.

He was 94 years old.\n\nHe died of heart failure, his wife, Virginia, said.\n\nMr. Campbell, a 1917 graduate of Harvard University, joined the Army Air Service just after the United States entered World War I and trained as a pilot in the United States.

Anderson, who was\nkilled while leading his company of 127 men over the top in\nFrance, on May 28th. Capt. Anderson was 30 years old May\n21st. He enlisted in the volunteer reserve corps when he was\n19, and served three years, having seen service in Panama.\nHe went to Mexico during the trouble down there as a second\nlietenant and after returning from there he left the army\nfor a short while, but re-enlisted with the regular army,\nand in 1914 he stood examination for a commission and sent\nto FortJay, New York. He went to France with General\nPershing's expeditionary forces and was said to be the first\nAmerican soldier to set foot on No Man's Land. He was here\nmade a captain and placed in command of a company of the\n28th Inf. and was leading this company in battle when\nkilled. His record on the other side was so brilliant that\nhe had been nominated by General Pershing to be a major, and\nthe senate just previous to his death had confirmed the\nnomination. Capt. Anderson was cited for gallantry in action\nand had been given a 28-day furlough. He had only returned\nto his command a few days when he was killed. Capt. Anderson\nstood very high as a military man and as an officer and\nundoubtedly had a bright future before him. Surviving Capt.\nAnderson are his father, Joseph S.

Committee on Public Information.

Once an attack ceased, trenches were cleared of low lying gas. One method required the use of an Ayrton or trench fan. This device consisted of a two-foot-long handle attached to a rigid piece of canvas hinged to a fifteen-inch section that moved in one direction. In effect the fan was used like a shovel, with the moveable flap creating an upward air current, thus removing the gas. Americans adopted these fans as called for by British defensive gas doctrine. Unfortunately, the fans, according to the British were &quot;worse than worthless.&quot; Not only did they not remove the vapor, but the exertion of masked users led to exhaustion and increased susceptibility to gassing. The fans were eventually discarded and burned to create an updraft, soon recognized as a better method of clearing trenches and dugouts of gas.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_2Dt1-shPY\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_2Dt1-shPY</a>\n\nThe Imperial War Museum has one:\n<a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30028501\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30028501</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachrach_Studios\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachrach_Studios</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Isaacs,_Marchioness_of_Reading\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Isaacs,_Marchioness_of_Reading</a>","and see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/26829322363/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Reading (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7342/26829322363_29ec65c1e9_z.jpg\" width=\"433\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Reading (LOC)\" /></a>","The photo studio:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachrach_Studios\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachrach_Studios</a>","Captain George Frederick Campbell of the Royal Flying Corps\n<a href=\"http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=446\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=446</a>","This photo appeared in the Crittenden record-press., June 06, 1918, Image 6 <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069460/1918-06-06/ed-1/seq-6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069460/1918-06-06/ed-...</a> and in the  Chattanooga news., June 14, 1918, Late Edition, Page 16, <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038531/1918-06-14/ed-1/seq-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038531/1918-06-14/ed-...</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Farrar\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Farrar</a>","&quot;Elias J.

His idea led to the establishment in 1922 of the music service Wired Radio, which is much better known by its present name, given it by Squier shortly before his death: Muzak.&quot;","Richard Norton and swanq: Thanks.

The tintype print is a &quot;direct positive on a thin sheet of metal coated with a dark lacquer or enamel and used as the support for the photographic emulsion.&quot;  (See Wikipedia.)  Inside the camera, there was a small drawer that held several unexposed sheets.  Using a long black silk sock in the back of the camera, the photographer would reach into the drawer, pull out a single sheet and position it to make the picture.  Once exposed, he reaches in again and slides the sheet into a monobath that's held in a metal can made into the back underside of the camera.  Look closely and  you can see it hanging from the back of the camera here, although most of it is obscured from view.  He would wait the appropriate time and then rotate the container so that the sheet could be retrieved through a small trap door it the tanks top at the back of the camera.  A simple wash with water (see his bucket?)  removed any remaining chemistry and brought out the image.  Here, he appears to be holding it to dry.  Normally it was then placed in a cardboard frame for the customer.\n\nPer this ad for one of the Daydark cameras (<a href=\"http://historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&amp;app=reference&amp;app_id=233&amp\" rel=\"nofollow\">historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_d...</a>;) you could make 500% markup and they had reports of people earning $10 to $12 a DAY!  (In 1910...)  [grin]","Fascinating. What a great image of a photo maker!","One can easily duplicate the tintype look in Photoshop.\nWhat fascinates me is what the image structure is saying – near center, the camera technology being examined/ discussed; far center, the large white guy with his back to the activity.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/22549175@N02] :  Sorry, but you really can't 'duplicate' the look of a real tintype in Photoshop.  And that hits on part of your other observation.  People were fascinated with the &quot;instant&quot; image from the photographer.  Because the emulsion was on top of the metal sheet,  I could fully see that as he's drying it, he's also tilting it in the light and the gentleman over his shoulder is studying the almost &quot;3D&quot; quality that the surface of a tintype has.\n\nAnd as far as the guy with his back to the group--he's just walking away (see the position of his legs).  I wouldn't read anything more about him in the photo other than he was part of the background.  Remember--these are street photographers from the 1910's-1930's.  Downtown was the like the mall today and you'd have lots of people around at any given time.  And these photographers were common--sometime too much so.   In the town where I grew up--Chattanooga, Tennessee--it got to be such a problem with so many street photographers getting pushy to ply their trade downtown that the city made it illegal to TAKE a photo on Market Street (the main road thru town).  I'm not sure if it's still on the books today, but as late as the 1980's it was still a &quot;blue law&quot; on the books.  Obviously the city fathers of the early 20th century never envisioned smartphones with their cameras of the 21st century...  [grin]","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/captkodak/]\n“…you really can't 'duplicate' the look of a real tintype in Photoshop…”\nOf course I agree, ink on paper or a back-illuminated screen can’t look exactly the same as any of the chemical processes, including a collodion process – but PS is working on 3-D effects.\n“Obviously the city fathers of the early 20th century never envisioned….”\nUndoubtedly they could ban a business operation, but photographing is protected: “To achieve First Amendment protection, a plaintiff must show that he possessed: (1) a message to be communicated; and (2) an audience to receive that message, regardless of the medium in which the message is to be expressed.”\nHere’s the message:\nThe center-of-influence is the camera. A camera is a device that produces a document. In the case of a portrait, that document signifies identity.\nThe group of African-American men is on either side of the center-of-influence. A triangle forms from them to the LARGE white man, back turned, and walking away.\nThe reading would be that African Americans formed their group identity in that way – separate from the larger white majority.\n\nIn that structural reading was perhaps a reality in American culture.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/22549175@N02] :Wow!  You made quite the jump there.  I really can't tell the ethnicity of the man walking away.  But if that suit the narrative you want to make up about the photo, go with it.  What I see is a street photographer doing what so many did during that time frame.  Shoot the photo, show it to the subject and generate excitement from the crowd that gathers to watch the making of this &quot;instant&quot; photo--all to get yet another customer.  He's making a living.  It's salesmanship.  Every culture and every ethnicity has someone who fills that roll.  Sometimes, it's really not about race...","See the contrast of the skin of the men in the foreground? See how the man in the background doesn't have that contrast on his skin, but his suit does?  See the name of the photographer? Rothstein, Arthur, 1915-1985, photographer, right at the top. I would bet money that in 1936, not one of the men in the foreground was a Rothstein, although one of them may have been his assistant. Now read the name of the album...&quot;Photographer in the Picture&quot; the dude in the background is definitely Mr. Rothstien.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/eclecticdesigner] :  Please read the description of the album.  It's not that THE photographer is in the picture, but a photographer is in the picture... \n\nThe original image is 2-1/4 x 2-1/4, it is most likely made with a hand held box camera or folding &quot;pocket&quot; camera of the day.  Think quick candid shot by a photographer from the &quot;Farm Security Administration&quot; sent to document life in and around the tobacco farming communities of North Carolina.  So I believe Mr. Rothstien took the image and is not in it.","what makes you think you're the only one educated in photography? how rude. I know it wasn't a point &amp; shoot camera. I spend more hours in a dark room in month than you probably have your whole life Mr.Kodak Easy Share","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/eclecticdesigner] :  I didn't say it was a &quot;point &amp; shoot&quot; camera.  Just that it wasn't another Daydark camera or a view camera of the era.  \n\nI've been doing freelance work off and on for almost 40 years, I use to sell cameras in a camera shop, I've taught photography for civic groups and summer camps, I have a fridge at home just for my film and over 250 cameras in my collection.  And, yes, have a darkroom.  The &quot;tech&quot; of cameras and photography is a hobby of mine along with a fascination of history.   So I'm not the &quot;only one educated in photography&quot; but I think I have somewhat of an understanding of it.  So before we start the name calling, I'm just here to share like most people are.  I have a fascination of street photographers and their tools.  Part of this is because one of my favorite photos I have of my parents was shot by a street photographer when they were dating teenagers:\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/captkodak/3502654410]\n\n(Mom hated this photo because of the guy &quot;checking her out&quot; over her shoulder.  [grin])  This photo was made in the 30's.  The street photographers then would shoot a candid of you as you walked down the street and then chase you down and try to sell it to you.","I don't understand why the tintype look can't be done in Photoshop. I thought Photoshop could create any kind of effect.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/7185088@N07] :  Photoshop (and many of the plug-ins you can get for it) will do a tintype look, but if you've seen a real tintype, you can immediately spot the difference.  For example, if I took a tintype, scanned it, and then printed it with contemporary printing methods and then produced a similar image out of Photoshop, both finished photos would look very similar.  However, if I compared the scanned/printed image to the original tintype, you would see that the new image misses a &quot;sheen&quot; in the blacks (which is the lacquer base of the image) and the image is &quot;flat&quot; while the true tintype has a raised emulsion--making it look almost like an engraving.  \n\nSo the issue is not as much what Photoshop can and cannot do, but how the final printed image is made.  You know--many of the print houses now produced metal prints which are actually printed on metal substrates.  I wonder if any of them have experimented with taking a tintype &quot;look&quot; image and producing a more realistic looking print.  That might be the technology that could best simulate it.","Thanks Steve. I have never seen a real tintype. Now I want to have a tintype portrait of myself created.","Thanks, Steve Harwood, for all the information about making tintypes. Arthur Rothstein, the FSA photographer who took the picture (but wasn't in it), can be seen with his camera here: <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/fsa.8a09935\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/fsa.8a09935</a>","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/barbara_loc] :  Thanks for that post.  The camera in that image appears to be a 4x5 field camera (possibly a Graflex based on the rangefinder viewfinder on the side and the flash handle on the other side--but we're looking at it from the back and it's hard to tell for sure).  And while you can get backs that adapter for 2-1/4x2-1/4 film, based on the clean edge of the image above, I would believe he shot it with a smaller camera.  The info on that shot indicates he's the photographer and it's from a 35mm negative.   35mm cameras were introduced in the mid 20's, but began to gain mainstream popularity right before WWII as new features--like self timers--became available on the cameras for the first time.  So it's actually possible he set up that shot and then made a &quot;selfie&quot;.  [grin]\n\nA point of note:  He would have been 22 or 23 years old in that photo.

It's a carom table that lacks the pockets.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/31580040@N04/] Have to disagree with you again my friend. I was a nine-ball player for almost twenty years and been around pool halls and major pool and billiard tournaments a large part of my life. In my youth I played snooker primarily in preparation of hustling (on what we termed, &quot;slop tables&quot; (8-ball pool).  \n\nRegulation Snooker tables are genuinely known as 12' x 6' tables (actual playing surface: 11'-8.5&quot; x 5-10&quot;) and they most definitely do have pockets, albeit, pockets smaller than a normal pool table (because snooker uses smaller balls). Additionally the pockets on a snooker table are not crescent shaped as on a normal pool table, making it more difficult to sink a ball especially when shooing from narrow angles. A player usually has to apply &quot;english&quot; (spin) on both, the cue ball which interacts with the object ball in order to sink difficult shots like these. Twenty-two balls are used in the game of snooker: 15 red balls, 6 numbered balls and of course, a cue ball.\n\nAlthough &quot;true billiards&quot; a/k/a &quot;English billiards is sometimes played on a pool table with pockets (as may be the case in the picture above) but this would not be considered regulation three-corner billiards and in no case would tournament billiards (nor any &quot;big money&quot;) billiards games be played on any table containing pockets. Some confusion exists because over time, the terms, &quot;billiards&quot; and &quot;pool&quot; have been used synonymously when in fact billiards and pool are two totally different types of games.\n\nThe rules of the game of &quot;9-ball pool&quot; are rather complex and I will not attempt to explain in this forum. These can be found here - <a href=\"http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&amp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&amp</a>;\n\nHope this clarifies everything.","This does appear to be a snooker table -I aslo grew up playing snooker but I never saw anyone playing billiards on one--there was a billiards table  for that in the pool hall. Still, that appears to be an 8 ball rather that the traditional red object ball.  I think it was just a posed publicity shot.  Wonder if the stoogie gets smoked while playing the cello?\nps hard to find a snooker table these days   only slop tables  What great finesse the great snooker players had---Guess where the phrase &quot;snookered&quot; came from?.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/freerangebob/] What make you think this is a snooker table?

But over here billiards is a game played with two white balls, distinguished by one having a spot, and a red ball on a table that can also be used for snooker.  The pockets are obvious in this picture <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_billiards#/media/File:Billiards_match_-_Spencer_Diggle.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_billiards#/media/File:Billi...</a> from 1899.

M. Zielinski, a noted\npatriot and orator, was assigned Number 1 and the recruiting center became known as &quot;Centrum 6.&quot; Being energetic and zealous Dr. Zielinski lost no time in organizing the scattered Polish colonies into one smooth functioning recruiting unit.&quot;\n\nThe Polish Falcons still exist.  This from their website:\n\n&quot;The vision of a resurrected, free Poland was close to the hearts of the early Falcon organization, which became a leader among Polish American groups in working toward this goal.  By 1917, over 25,000 young Polish American men were trained by the Polish Falcons to serve in a proposed Polish military force.  During World War I, these Falcon-trained troops became the core of the Polish-American expeditionary force in France and the eventual nucleus of the Polish Army.  At the Polish Falcons Convention held in Pittsburgh on April 3, 1917, the renowned pianist and future premier of newly independent Poland, Ignacy Paderewski, delivered a rousing speech that sparked the recruitment of a Polish Army in the United States to fight for the Western Allies against Germany.  Over 35,000 Polish-American men enlisted in the Allied war effort.   In particular, these Falcon trained troops fought in the famous “Blue Army” under the leadership of General Jozef Haller. When Poland regained its independence in 1918, these troops helped to form the nucleus of the young country’s armed forces as neighboring countries immediately attacked Poland, including the fierce Bolshevik Red Army that was planning on spreading communism into Europe by invading Poland.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.polishfalcons.org/History\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.polishfalcons.org/History</a>","Art Siegel:  Thanks for linking these folks to the Polish Falcons.

This immediate strain on the U.S. labor force created problems for industry, which became overburdened by wartime production requirements. The War Labor Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Labor, worked to resolve these problems in part by replacing male workers with female ones. Realizing that women's labor issues needed to be addressed specifically, as well as to prevent them from disrupting wartime production, the Department of Labor created the Women in Industry Service (WIS) in 1918.\n\nThis cooperative-based bureau was run by women for women. Most of its policy suggestions for addressing women's labor issues were later implemented. Although the end of the war in November 1918 meant the return of men to industry, the WIS succeeded in bringing governmental attention to the rights of women laborers. The WIS operated until 1920, when Congress granted the bureau permanent status through public law; the organization then became known as the U.S. Women's Bureau. As the only federal organization devoted to the welfare of working women, the Women's Bureau became a powerful advocate for their rights, conducting industry research and helping to shape public policy regarding their welfare.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3408900320/women-industry-service.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3408900320/women-industr...</a>","Thanks Art Siegel for tracking down the publication of the Emily Murphy photo.

(December 24, 1917 in New York Times)\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504E2DC1E3BE03ABC4C51DFB467838C609EDE\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504E2DC1E3BE0...</a>\n\nI added him to Wikidata:\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21995632\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21995632</a>\n\nBiography:\nJames Edgar Gregg. Born at Hartford, Conn., Nov. 24, 1875. Son of James Bartlett and Mary (Needham) Gregg. School: Cutler Academy, Colorado Springs, Col. Years In College: 1893-97. A.B.; A.M. 1901; B.D. 1903 (Yale). Married: Pauline Pumpelly, March 16, 1903, Middletown, R.I., died May 27, 1911; Mary Livingston Hinsdale, Pittsfield, Mass., June 10, 1914. Children: Elise Pumpelly, April 3, 1908; James, Sept. 1, 1909; Theodore Hinsdale, April 17, 1915; Gerald Hinsdale, Sept. 3, 1916. Occupation: School principal. Address: Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va. In the autumn of 1897 I went to Newport, R.I., where I served as an instructor in St. George's School for three years. I then returned to Cambridge to study theology in the Harvard Divinity School for one year, at the close of which I received a Master's degree. I took two more years of theology at Yale, receiving there the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1903. My first parish was that of the Pilgrim Memorial Church in Pittsfield, Mass., where I was from July, 1903, till October, 1909. From October, 1909, till March, 1912, I was minister of Kirk Street Church, Lowell, Mass.; returning thence to Pittsfield to become minister of the First Church of Christ (Congregational), of which my earlier Pittsfield charge was an outgrowth. It was pleasant for many reasons to renew former associations in the Berkshires; and I had six years of profitable and happy experience with the old First Church, until in April, 1918, I came to Hampton Institute to serve as its principal, in succession to the late Dr. Hollis Burke Frissell. It has been a great privilege to be admitted to the circle of his friends, both in the North and in the South; and the enterprise of promoting the true &quot; education for life&quot; of Negro and Indian youth, as carried on according to the principles of General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and Dr. Booker T. Washington, becomes more and more interesting as an adventure, and more sobering as a responsibility, the deeper one gets into it. I was abroad for a few weeks in the autumn of 1911, visiting England and Scotland; where, in company with a boy, I had traveled in the summer of 1899. I am sorry that I have no war record to relate to my grandchildren, and that my printed compositions are so few as scarcely to be worth listing. An article entitled &quot;Pedagogy and Atonement&quot; in the Biblical Review, published at the University of Chicago, in the issue of April, 1915 (?), and an occasional short article on some aspect of the Negro question practically comprise my output. I trust that any members of the class who may visit Norfolk or Old Point Comfort will not fail to look me up and let me show them the work of the Institute and the other points of interest, such as Langley Field and the Newport News Shipyard in this neighborhood. Hampton is said to be the oldest continuously inhabited settlement of English-speaking people on the North American continent. Yorktown and Williamsburg are within easy motoring distance; and we expect before long to have a good road all the way from Richmond to the end of the Peninsula. Publications: &quot;Atonement,&quot; in the Biblical Review, April, 1915. Published at University of Chicago. An occasional short article on some aspect of the Negro question.

Mr Hardy recently returned to the scenes of his adventures. He visited the port of Kurihama where the Perry party landed. It is interesting to note that the entire population was in holiday attire for the visitor, that the .streets were decorated with lanterns and the Stars and Stripes that school children stood in line along the way and that all carried American flags which they waved, shouting loud Banzais as Mr Hardy rode through the crowded thoroughfares.  He responded by waving his sailor's cap and on arriving at the monument erected to commemorate the expedition knelt in prayer and planted an Oregon pine tree which he had brought with him from America.  One of the Japanese who welcomed the Perry Expedition was present to welcome this survivor. As reported by the New York Japanese American Commercial Weekly,  Mr Hardy expressed his astonishment at the splendid progress Japan has made during the 64 years which have elapsed since he first landed there and his satisfaction that now the flags of America and Japan are crossed as a symbol of the friendship existing between the two nations.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=pWvnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=pWvnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA281&amp;l...</a>","Art Siegel:  thank you for the information about Willam Hardy and why he is planting this pine tree in Japan.

To his energy and foresight belong the credit for putting it over.  At the little ceremony of the driving of the first rivet Mr Worden said 'You have seen this operation of driving the first rivet.  It must be repeated 350,000 times before we launch this ship into the waters of the bay.  Six more ships must be built on this way before our bit is done.  Beyond you stretches for over half a mile the bulkhead fronting the waters of the bay. We are now seeking to complete the other ways and on each one of the twenty eight we must repeat this operation six times. Our task is unprecedented. These ships must be done in a length of time hitherto impossible. The dead steel that goes into these ships is to be converted into a scourge to the Huns, who now covet our fair land.

Quite forgotten today, Swan had an instinct for the right place and time to display his talents: on the vaudeville circuit in the teens, twenties, and thirties, in the Warhol crowd in the sixties. (Warhol filmed the elderly Swan creakily performing his campy, dancelike imitations of Greek heroes.) That instinct helped him to escape his dreary, rural Nebraska childhood home, a place deeply unpropitious to an artistic child with homosexual feelings; to make opportunities of what others found dead ends; and to propel himself from Chicago to New York and beyond, sometimes as a model, sometimes as an artist, always as a talented, resourceful American bohemian, wearing many hats to pay the rent while always returning to his easel. If Swan never painted a recognized masterpiece or choreographed a dance to equal those of Jerome Robbins or George Balanchine, the Londravilles' highly readable biography argues that, however minor, Swan matters.&quot;     -- Jack Helbig\nCopyright © American Library Association.

She owes this position as president of one of the most important war relief organizations (perhaps after the Red Cross the most important) to the energy, conscientiousness, and brilliant executive abilities she had demonstrated while at the Front in charge of more than one hospital. She is an infirmiere major and was decorated twice for cool courage and resource under fire.\n     The object of Le Bien-Etre du Blesse is to provide delicacies for the dietary kitchens of the hospitals in the War Zone, as many officers and soldiers had died because unable to eat eggs, or drink milk, the only two articles furnished by the rigid military system of the most conservative country in the world. The articles supplied by Le Bien-Etre du Blesse are very simple: condensed milk, sugar, cocoa, Franco-American soups, chocolate, sweet biscuits, jams, preserves, prunes, tea. Thousands of lives have been saved by Bien-Etre during the past year; for men who are past caring, or wish only for the release of death, have been coaxed back to life by a bit of jam on the tip of a biscuit, or a teaspoonful of chicken soup.\n     Some day I shall write the full and somewhat complicated history of Le Bien-Etre du Blesse, quoting from many of Madame d'Andigne's delightful letters. But there is no space here and I will merely mention that my own part as the American President of Le Bien-Etre du Blesse is to provide the major part of the funds with which it is run, lest any of my readers should be tempted to help me out.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.readbookonline.net/read/37964/75094/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.readbookonline.net/read/37964/75094/</a> \n\n\nsee <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/23722415282/in/photostream/\" title=\"Motor Cycle Ambulance -- Hero Land (LOC)\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/630/23722415282_4ac758e967.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\" alt=\"Motor Cycle Ambulance -- Hero Land (LOC)\" /></a>","See\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/23804700166/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/23804700166/</a>","B-59, we can add info to records for this tenor.","&quot;James Reed Miller (February 29, 1880 – December 29, 1923), who recorded as Reed Miller and as James Reed, was an American tenor who had an active career as a concert and oratorio singer during the first quarter of the 20th century.

While playing halfback for Harvard, Mahan was selected as a first-team All-American three consecutive years from 1913–1915. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in the first 50 years of the sport and was named by Jim Thorpe as the greatest football player of all time. In 1951, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as part of the first group of inductees.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mahan\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mahan</a>","Camp Douglas was established in October 1862 as a small military garrison about three miles east of Salt Lake City, Utah, for the purpose of protecting the overland mail route and telegraph lines along the Central Overland Route. In 1878, the post was renamed Fort Douglas. The fort was officially closed in 1991,[3] and most of the buildings were turned over to the University of Utah. A small section of the original fort is used by the Army Reserve and includes the Fort Douglas Military Museum.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Douglas\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Douglas</a>","From the Fort Douglas website;\n\n&quot;The War Department announced that Fort Douglas was to be an Internee Camp on 2 May 1917. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that it was &quot;generally understood that Fort Douglas will be used as a concentration camp where German reservists, known enemies of the government, interned sailors, and other undesirables from the Pacific coast section of the country will be held under military restraint until the war is ended.&quot;\n\nConstruction of War Prison Barracks Three began on the lower parade ground of Fort Douglas, just east of the University campus. The compound was on fifteen acres of land. It measured 922 feet by 748 feet, and consisted of four rows of twelve buildings each; the first row was private quarters for officers; the second, mess halls; the third, barracks; and the fourth, bathhouses. Each barracks was 217 feet long and 20 feet wide equipped with 50 double bunk beds with metal springs.\n\n \n\nThe compound was surrounded by two ten-foot barbed wire fences spaced twenty feet apart and the inner fence was at least 75 feet from the nearest barracks. A &quot;dead line&quot;, beyond which the prisoners were not permitted to walk, was marked ten feet from the inner fence and the outer fence was electrified at the top. Each corner of the square compound had a guard tower; the two on the northwest and southwest corners were 35 feet tall and equipped with a searchlight, while the other two were only 15 feet tall. All four towers were equipped with water-cooled machine guns.\n\nThe first group of prisoners arrived by train in Salt Lake City on 10 June 1917. The 320 prisoners were German sailors who had been captured near Guam when their German ship, the SMS Cormoran, had been scuttled. The prisoners were transported to Fort Douglas by street car. Enemy aliens began plotting their escape almost from the very moment they arrived at the prison compound. During the three years the War Prison Barracks Three was in operation, there was constant trouble between the prison administration and the internees. Prisoners constantly caused problems by refusing to work, refusing to obey orders, throwing stones at the guards, shouting obscenities, and singing provocative and insulting songs. Scores of tunnels were discovered that had been dug by the prisoners. As the personal property of the prisoners was searched, wire cutters and other equipped used to escape was found. On several occasions prisoners attempting to get between the security fences were shot and wounded with shotguns.&quot;\nmore at \n<a href=\"http://www.fortdouglas.org/wwi-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.fortdouglas.org/wwi-years</a>","This photo ran in The sun., October 27, 1918, Section 4 Magazine Section, Page 5\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1918-10-27/ed-1/seq-33/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1918-10-27/ed-...</a>\nand in the Evening public ledger., October 26, 1918, Night Extra, Image 5\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1918-10-26/ed-1/seq-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1918-10-26/ed-...</a>\n\nAn aerial view of the camp was displayed in Goodwin's weekly : a thinking paper for thinking people., July 14, 1917, Page 9\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2010218519/1917-07-14/ed-1/seq-11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2010218519/1917-07-14/ed-...</a>","The grounds of the old post are mostly owned by the University of Utah today, although a small part of it remains an Army Reserve post.

During a 2-hr event in Syracuse, NY, the tank raised $868.45 (the equivalent of $13,221.12 today). The purchase of a war thrift stamp allowed one to view the tank up close. For the larger purchase of a war stamp for $4.15 ($63.12 today), one was allowed into the vehicle’s interior, presumably with a guided tour from the crew. It was sometime during this American tour that the crew changed the tank’s name from “Britannia” to “Liberty.” Appropriately, the tank and its crew were also the main attraction in the Liberty Day Parade in New York City. ... Liberty found its final home in 1919 when it was taken to northeastern Maryland and added to the collection of the newly established Ordnance Museum at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD ... . Since that time, it has remained one of the museum’s cornerstone attractions and has stood as a reminder of the significant advancements that have been made in armored warfare over the past century.</i>\n\nAlso, this tank is the subject of a Flickr album created by Flickr user Charlie Webb:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cmwebbjr/sets/72157634959239855/]","This photo was taken on October 25, 1917 at the Liberty (Loan) Parade, s. article in The evening world., October 25, 1917, Final Edition, Image 1, &quot;25,000 IN LIBERTY PARADE CHEERED BY BIG THRONGS; BRITISH &quot;TANK&quot; A FEATURE&quot;\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1917-10-25/ed-1/seq-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1917-10-25/ed-...</a>\n\nSimilar photos are in the New-York tribune., October 26, 1917, Page 2 <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1917-10-26/ed-1/seq-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1917-10-26/ed-...</a> and in The sun., November 04, 1917, Section 4 Pictorial Magazine, Image 41 <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-11-04/ed-1/seq-41/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1917-11-04/ed-...</a>.","TVL 1970: Unbelievable that this tank still exists!

Five years later she was singing <i>Fedora</i> with Enrico Caruso in Paris, which, together, they took to the Metropolitan Opera a year later. The Met contracted her to debut in Fedora for $1,000 a night opposite Caruso – a sum far exceeded that paid to Geraldine Farrar, the Met’s reigning diva. \n\nShe was frequently described as &quot;the world's most beautiful woman&quot; – and was likely the most photographed woman of her time, appearing in hundreds of magazines in America and throughout Europe – and she was a &quot;Palmolive girl&quot; which featured full-page advertisements of her giving beauty tips.\n\nLina Cavalieri became the first opera star to successfully make the transition from the lyric opera to the silent screen and she made nearly a dozen American and Italian films.\n\nAfter her death, her extraordinary life story was adapted as stage play and film.  Garbo played a version of her, renamed as &quot;Madame Rita Cavallini&quot; in Romance (1930), and she was played by Gina Lollobrigida in the 1955 film <i>La donna più bella del mondo.</i>","see:\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/22411281715]","Richard Norton:  Thanks.

This not only reviewed the common history of the two nations for three hundred years, and suggested a programme for making the bonds tighter yet, but it brought the British public practical assurances as to America's intentions in the conflict. Up to that time there had been much vagueness and doubt; no official voice had spoken the clear word for the United States; the British public did not know what to expect from their kinsmen overseas.

(The engine would have been common in US stocks, as it powered a number of US military aircraft and it was produced under-license by the Wright Company). What is unusual for the era (if the 1922 photo date is correct) is that the engine appears to be driving an adjustable or variable pitch propeller - which is a type that would have been a cutting-edge technology under development during the time.\n\nGiven that information, I can say with an <i>almost certainty</i> that this is a photograph illustrating a demonstration of the Paragon Adjustable and Reversible Propeller, most probably at or near Bolling Field in Washington, D.C. \n\nThe December 1922 <i>Aerial Age Weekly</i> (Vol. 15, Pages 585-589) details the apparatus and the adjustable pitch propeller demonstrated, note also the photos on page 588 of the linked article which appears to show the test stand photographed above.\n\nAlso, after examining the finer resolution TIFF version of this photo at the LOC site linked above, it would appear that Spencer Heath (1876-1963), the man who developed the variable pitch propeller being demonstrated, is the bearded man in the white (or light colored) coat leaning over the controls in the photo.

Wright-Hispano engine was mounted, was made to maneuver about Bolling Field at the will of the operator.\n\nWhat new stunts may now be evolved with the aid of a reversing propeller may be left to the imagination. One can easily imagine the two-seater of the future suddenly reversing into a stall and taking a shot from underneath at his surprised adversary overhead. The device is to the aircraft what change speed gears are to the automobile. . . .\n\n<b> Demonstration Under Power</b>\nTo show the action under power the propeller has been installed on a 150 H.P. Hispano-Suiza engine mounted with gasoline tank, observers’ seats, etc., on a trailer truck weighing about two tons which is free to roll on the ground. In the demonstrations thus far made the device is put through its entire range of performance, which includes disconnecting the pitch limiting mechanism so that the blade angels are controlled throughout a compete revolution of 360 degrees, both forward and reverse.\n\nWith the engine turning at 1500 r.p.m. the angular change from full speed ahead to full speed astern is accomplished in about 3-1/3 seconds.</blockquote>","Excellent work.. that's definitely the same thing pictured in the December, 1922 Aerial Age.","Thanks for all the good information TVL1970.

There was a long, involved set of lawsuits involving De Forest and Armstrong, also involving RCA and Westinghouse, over ownership of patents involved in the development of early radio.  If you look at photos of De Forest and Armstrong in the 1928 era, you'll see they are all using loop antennas (very similar to above) to demonstrate their radio technology in their labs.","Also, likely not just RDF as there are three units in the photo: on the left, a power supply (battery?); the middle unit (I would guess a receiver as the operator appears to be tuning around to receive a signal), and the right side unit (give it appears to have a plate and load control for a vacuum tube, typical with a transmitter).  Also looks to be homebrewed equipment built by the operator, not commercial gear (at least none that survives to the modern era on the various collector websites). At that time, the transmitter also probably would only have a single frequency, hence the lack of frequency control on that transmitter box.","We recently found some old catalog cards for Harris &amp; Ewing that had a caption for this photo.

Before 1836 ice was cut from the rivers during the winters and stored for summer use but according to the oldtimers the supply ran out along about the 29th of July. Dr. Gorrie spent his entire personal fortune attempting to develop his idea. And he died without realizing that he would some day be recognized as a great benefactor of mankind.

Salm was one of three brothers prominent in lawn tennis. The eldest and the best player is Ludwig who remained in Europe during the war and was engaged in it on the Austrian side of course. The youngest brother Alexander came to New York with Otto about 1912 accompanied by Georges Aranyi a Hungarian who had been engaged in business in Paris. The three took part in a number of tournaments in this country, Otto being the most consistent participant in match play as well as the most successful. He won the Maine championship if memory serves before this country became involved in the war and he had some other good performances to his credit. His play was at times brilliant but nearly always erratic. Both Otto Salm and Aranyi became involved in the ban placed on enemy players by the USLTA and they did not compete in tournaments here after 1916.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=6GQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA534&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;dq=otto+salm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BLINVRqQgU&amp;sig=6abBPWld6Ync4wIKqyPTz2wHqOk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCWoVChMI66bdjfuYyAIVAymICh13FwPn#v=onepage&amp;q=otto salm&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=6GQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA534&amp;l...</a>","Thanks, All, we'll add Otto's name to record.","Paul Alexander Wolf (1868-1954)\nA 1920 biographical sketch:\n&quot;Paul Alexander Wolf commander of the Sixty sixth Infantry Brigade is a native of the state whose soldiers he led in France He was born in Kewanee Illinois December 23 1868 and was appointed to West Point from Princeton Illinois in 1886 Following his graduation General Wolf then a second lieutenant served with the Third Infantry in the winter of 1890 91 in the last important Indian campaign that against the Sioux in South Dakota He served in Cuba in the Spanish American War and in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902 being on the staff of General Frederick Funston during a part of the time He served in the Philippines again from 1903 to 1905 taking active part in the third Moro campaign on the staff of Major General Leonard Wood In 1913 and 1914 he was on the Mexican border and in April of the latter year he went to Vera Cruz Mexico where he served as chief of public works during the seven months of American occupation General Wolf was made a lieutenant colonel in 1916 and a colonel in the National Army in August 191 7 He commanded the two officers training camps at Plattsburg New York from May 1 to December 22 191 7 and commissioned 8,000 officers from these camps He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in February 1918 and assigned to command the Sixty sixth Infantry Brigade of the Thirty third Division General Wolf led this brigade through the fighting in France and until its return to the United States in May 1919 He remained in France to serve as captain of the AEF rifle team which won first place in the inter allied competition at Le Mans in July 1919 General Wolf's services were recognized by the United States government by the award of the Distinguished Service Medal He received also the decorations of Officer of the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre with Palm from the French and Companion of the Bath from the British &quot;\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=geALAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=maj.+gen.+paul+alexander+wolf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ff_qiCqg74&amp;sig=WGs-3XCAFKyH8UJAZRivKGLvZyk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMIjtLIppaUyAIVBy2ICh30UAm_#v=onepage&amp;q=maj. gen. paul alexander wolf&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=geALAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;l...</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=131763307\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=131763307</a>","In August 1917 he served as a linesman in a tennis match between Mary Browne and Molla Bjurstedt at Forest Hills (M.
