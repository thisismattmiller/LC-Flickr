The quote below explains why there are so many women in the photo:\r\n\r\n&quot;It may seem strange or ironic that women played such an important role in a party nicknamed the &quot;Bull Moose Party,&quot; but the Progressive or Bull Moose Party welcomed women into leadership positions as no major party had before. The high status of women in the Progressive Party reflected the party's strong advocacy of women's suffrage and women's rights, and the emphasis that Theodore Roosevelt, the party's presidential candidate in 1912, gave to women's issues. Up to this time, no male of Theodore Roosevelt's prominence and popularity had endorsed women's suffrage, and in 1912 neither the Republican candidate, President William Howard Taft, running for reelection, or Democrat Woodrow Wilson, endorsed women's suffrage on the national level. In 1912 women had the vote in several Western states, but in no state east of the Mississippi River.&quot;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/bullmoose.htm\">www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/bullmoose.htm</a>","By the way, it was New Zealand who first gave women the vote in the previous century, followed by my home state, South Australia.

Wilson and Clark each won a number of primaries, and Clark arrived at the convention with the largest number of delegates pledged to him. When the convention opened Clark received the support of the Tammany Organization in New York. That support had the effect of turning Byran who had been largely neutral into an opponent of Clarke. On the first ballot however, Clark led with 440 1/4 votes to 324 for Wilson, 148 for Harmon 117 1/4 for Underwood and the rest scattered. Ballots continued all evening. On the ninth ballot the New York delegation changed its vote to support Clark giving him a majority of the votes. In past conventions that would have been enough to begin a bandwagon for Clark, quickly giving him the 2/3 needed. Instead this time the opposition held their ground. Now once again Byran took center stage in a speech castigating Clark for being in the pocket privilege class. This solidified the anti Clark forces which centered on Wilson. Balloting continued for two days however, until on the 46th ballot Wilson acheived 2/3 of the votes and became the nominiee. \r\n \r\n<a href=\"http://www.multied.com/elections/Conventions/1912DEM.html\">www.multied.com/elections/Conventions/1912DEM.html</a>","Thanks for the info.

Fei Hung was one of a trio of small training cruisers ordered by the Chinese navy in 1910. The first of the class (Ying Swei) was completed in 1911 and delivered as scheduled, but the 1912 Chinese Revolution intervened before the remaining two ships, Chao Ho and Fei Hung, could be delivered. Both were placed up for sale, but were completed by their builders prior to being sold, probably in hope of attracting a buyer. Fei Hung was completed in 1913, and is seen here on trials, still owned by her builders, New York Shipbuilding. In 1914 she was sold to Greece and renamed Helle. Her sister Chao Ho did not find a buyer, and accepted by the Chinese navy, as originally intended.\r\n\r\nHelle had an interesting career. In 1916-1917 she served under the French flag, following the French seizure of the Greek fleet. She was completely reconstructed in 1926-1928, emerging as a cruiser-minelayer, with new machinery, superstructure, masts, and fire controls, modified armament, and increased armor. Helle was torpedoed and sunk by an Italian submarine, 15 August 1940, while at anchor off Tinos Island. This incident caused considerable anger, as Greece had not yet entered the war, and the Italian cruiser Eugenuio Di Savoia was provided postwar as a replacement for Helle.\\","Also you can have a look in the Hellenic Navy page to see a photo of Helle in the interwar years as well as another image of the first torpedo that missed her in Tinos Island exploding on the dock. <a href=\"http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/ellh.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.hellenicnavy.gr/ellh.asp</a>","This is upside down.","Fixed orientation (finally).

The Pittsburgh Pirates' shortstop was a sensational hitter, a brilliant base-runner and a flawless fielder. He broke into the majors by hitting .344 in 1897 and put together 17 consecutive .300 seasons. He was the NL batting champion for seven of those 17 seasons with a lifetime average of .329. \r\n\r\nOne of the first five players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he led the league in stolen bases on six occasions, finishing his career with a total of 722 steals. Wagner retired with more hits, runs, RBI, doubles, triples, games and steals than any other National League player.\r\n\r\nAfter his career as a player, Honus became a manager for his longtime team, the Pittsburgh Pirates.\r\n\r\nThe Honus Wagner baseball card, one of the most valuable in existence today, was recalled in 1909. At the time, the cards were distributed along with tobacco; Wagner, a nonsmoker, objected to being included in the promotion because he did not want to set a bad example for children.\r\n\r\nfrom <a href=\"http://www.honuswagner.com/biography.htm\">Honus Wagner Biography</a>","Very cool....I've been told my entire life (53 years) that Marty O'Toole and I were related.

(there are other seperate letters represented by combinations of english letters e.g. CH, DD, FF, LL, RH)\n\nLLwyn y pia is part of the county of &quot;Rhondda Cynon Taf&quot; as it is called today. Back when this photo was taken it was part of a very large County called &quot;Glamorgan&quot; which was split into 3 counties in the 1970s (South, Mid and West Glamorgan), and in the 1990s into many counties based more on the cities in them e.g. City and County of Swansea (formerly West Glamorgan).\n\nYou can get a good feeling of what life was like at the time shown in the photo by visiting several &quot;living&quot; museums in South Wales e.g. \n\n- St. Ffagans Heritage and Folk Museum - Outside Cardiff on the road A48 I think. They have a whole row of miner's cottages showing each house decorated for a different period e.g. early 1800s, mid 1800s, late 1800s, 1900 turn of century, 1940s, 1950s, 1980s, or similar - its like being in HG Well's time machine as you walk up the row of houses.\n\n- Big Pit - Near Caerleon, town called Blaenavon - this is a MUST see - its a REAL coal mine, you go down several hundred feet in a cage elevator, then you walk around one of two routes underground with a guide - one tour takes you around the old types of mining - what it was like to be a kid in the mines, old equipment and workings, Pit pony stables (yes they used horses underground). The other route takes you around the modern mining area. The mine is inspected by government to commercial standards - ITS TOTALLY safe, the only reason civilians are allowed in the mine is you can also walk out of the mine by walking about 1km out of the side of the mountain (its also a drift mine as well as a deep navigation mine).\n\nBOTH Museums are free (2008 time of writing). \n\nYou can also read the books &quot;Rape of the fair country&quot; and &quot;how green was my valley&quot; by &quot;Alexander Cordell&quot; to understand what life was like in these communities in the industrial revolution (about 150 years before this).\n\nTo see a small town like this in film set at exactly the same time watch the film &quot;The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain&quot; starring Colm Meaney and Hugh Grant - funny, lovely movie about a tight knit valley's community.\n\nIncidentally my father was born in LLwyn y pia.","Yep its Llwynypia not Llwynpia - that would make it grove/bush magpie not grove.bus of the magpie. Grew up there and my sister was born in the hospital you can see on the hill at the back.","I second the Alexander Cordell books as recommended (essential!) reading around this subject matter. \n\nLlwynypia has never really recovered from the closure of the collieries, and even today, it is one of the areas listed in the <a href=\"http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/publications/wimd08sum/?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">new.wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/publications/wimd08sum...</a> available online, as well as this wonderful coal swathed portrait of <a href=\"http://www.llwynypialocal.co.uk/PhotoGallery.aspx?action=viewimage&amp;imageid=25&amp;categoryid=3\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 'John Davies aged 12</a>, one of the many children used in the physically demanding and dangerous work-environment of the mine shafts. \n\nAverage life expectancy was significantly reduced as the risk of colliery accidents were high. interestingly, after very little searching I've been able to find this reference to the <a href=\"http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:2166940&amp;id=I111391834\" rel=\"nofollow\">death of George Henry Gaylard</a>, who was born in Llwynypia in 1878, but died in an accident at Llwynypia colliery, aged 21 years. :( While he was born in the area, both his parents are recorded as having originated from Somerset. Whilst it isn't stated clearly, it appears that they probably moved over the border to Llwynypia for the employment opportunities offered by the presence of the colliery, where they subsequently stayed to raise their family. This 'sits' with my own family history, as my great-great-grandparents on my fathers side of the family, were from the area of Calne in Wiltshire, but moved to the Ebbw Vale/Brynmawr area of Wales (the county of Blaenau Gwent). \n\nMy great-great grandfather and my great uncle were miners. My father recalls meeting my great-uncle after the shift was over, at the pit head, on many, many occasions; and coal blackened as he was, carrying dad home on his shoulders, where both would be chastised by my great-grandmother, for getting so dirty. Subsequently, a big metal bath tub would be taken off the hook and placed in front of a roaring fire, where it would then be filled with scalding water. The youngest member of the family (at that time, my father) would be plunged into the water first, scrubbed, hauled out, followed by the next oldest and so... Re-using the bathwater until every member of the family was clean.</a></a>","Ok - I've found out some more.\n\nThe owner of the Glamorgan coalmines, (who is described variously as a mining engineer and entrepreneur) was one Archibald Hood (1823-1902). According to <a href=\"http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/people/famousfirst791.html\">this site here,</a> and <a href=\"http://www.therhondda.co.uk/personalities/archibald_hood.html\">this site here</a>, he grew up in Kilmarnock (East Ayrshire) in Scotland. This might explain why the 'Scotland' tag was attributed to some of the welsh coal mining images from this collection. The Llwynypia Colliery became strongly associated with Archibald Hood, and was known locally as 'The 'Scotch' Colliery.\n\nArchibald Hood was apparently brought up by his father (a widower), who was by trade, a colliery foreman. Hood himself started off with very little education and at the age of 12 was working in the mines himself. However, when his father became the manager of a colliery near Glasgow, Hood went on to study and qualify as a mining engineer. He then leased and operated pits/collieries all over the midlothian coalfields and developed a reputation as a moderniser, recognising that improving the conditions of the workers (both practically in the mines, and socially) would result in a more productive workforce. He went on to co-found the Lothian Coal Company in 1890, alongside Schomberg Kerr, 9th Marquess of Lothian (1833 - 1900)\n\nHood began working in the welsh coalfields/collieries in 1862, when he established the Glamorgan Coal Company; modernising and extending the pits in the area. At its peak there were 140 coke ovens, and a large brickworks which Hood also founded. In 1908, the colliery became part of the <a href=\"http://www.therhondda.co.uk/facts/cambrian_growth.html\">Cambrian Combine</a>, and the waste gases from the coking process, were also used to provide electricity for the colliery and to power the streetlights in the local communities. Hood actually moved to Wales in 1867, was very active in the civic life of the community in Cardiff and throughout Glamorgan, and was well liked. Although he maintained his management of the Scottish collieries, he lived in Cardiff where he eventually died and is buried.  \n\nThere is actually a statue/memorial to hood in Llwynypia, you can see a picture of that <a href=\"http://www.anglesey.info/Llwynypia - Archibald Hood.jpg\">here</a>. (Although it is somewhat dwarfed by the large number of people crowded nearby!)\n\nThere is a really detailed history of Llwnypia <a href=\"http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taff.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/llwynypia/llwynypia.htm\">here</a>, which is fascinating. It also confirms that the name 'Llwynypia' translates from Welsh to English as '‚ÄòThe grove of the bush of the magpie' and 'derives its name from a farm that stood on the land pre-industrialisation'.\n\nThe 1910 Cambrian Combine Miners Strike &amp; Tonypandy Riot is covered <a href=\"http://libcom.org/history/1910-cambrian-combine-miners-strike-and-tonypandy-riot\">here</a>. (The strike itself became popularly known as The Tonypandy Riot.) It has become renown for being one of the few occasions in British history when troops were deployed against British workers. The strike began on August 01st 1910, and was a bitter dispute, with widespread consequences for miners across the region. The link outlines this in some detail.","Thanks!

About 120 children left Lawrence on February 10 and were met at the station in New York City by 5000 members of the Italian Socialist Federation and the Socialist Party singing the &quot;Internationale&quot; and &quot;The Marsaillaise.&quot; The youngsters were placed in homes which had been selected by a women's committee of New York sympathizers. Margaret Sanger, later famous for her work in birth control, was one of the nurses who accompanied the children on the train to New York City. She testified before a congressional committee in March: &quot;Out of the 119 children, only four had underwear on ... their outerwear was almost in rags . . . their coats were simply torn to shreds ... and it was the bitterest weather we have had this winter.&quot;\n&quot;A few weeks later, ninety-two more children arrived in New York City and, before going to their temporary foster homes, paraded with banners down Fifth Avenue. &quot;","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1094352@N23/\">sad world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/974085@N23/\">The Natural Beauty of Children</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/970265@N21/\">Natural Children's Best Pictures</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","amazing image","I think that's Charles Comiskey, second from left in front row.","At center bottom is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Johnson\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Johnson</a> , &quot;Byron Bancroft &quot;Ban&quot; Johnson (January 5, 1864 ‚Äì March 28, 1931), ...the founder and first president of the American League.&quot;\n\nAnother Bain shot of American League owners in 1914:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083178405/\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6075/6083178405_cf2957b593_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"[AL club presidents: Frank Navin, Detroit; Benjamin S.

Our practice when we digitize is to try to represent the artifact as faithfully as possible for the sake of both research and preservation. Original negatives often exhibit signs of deterioration, and we do not attempt to correct those flaws in the scanning process. With images such as this, which have &quot;no known copyright restrictions,&quot; people may choose to alter or adjust the file when they use it.\n\nPlease let me know if I haven't understood your question.

On 14 December 1911, Amundsen, Hanssen, Bjaaland, Hassel and Wisting reached the South Pole.  She stopped briefly at Hobart before heading round Cape Horn to Buenos Aires, waited for some weeks at Colon to try and be the first ship through the Panama Canal to no avail (one newspaper report suggested her mainmast was too tall), set out for the Bering Strait via Cape Horn but abandoned the attempt  (and did not apparently reach San Francisco as planned) and returned to Buenos Aires.    In 1914, she was ordered back to Norway and then found to have dry rot.  I find no clues as to where this picture might have been taken -- although it clearly was not in the Antarctic!!.  Plenty of pictures, including in the article below, confirm that the photo is indeed of the famous Fram.\r\n\r\nSee <a href=\"http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic42-4-384.pdf\">pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic42-4-384.pdf</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fram.museum.no/en/\">www.fram.museum.no/en/</a> \r\n\r\nPuzzlingly, it is in pictures from an earlier (1898-1902) expedition to the Arctic that she has a coat of light-colored paint as here.

We‚Äôll update the source description and reload the record.","The Fram is more famous to me for her association with the scientist-explorer-humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen than with Amundsen.  In 1893 Nansen attempted to reach the North Pole by deliberately allowing the Fram to freeze into the ice pack and then be passively carried across the pole by currents (which he had deduced, based on patterns of deposition of driftwood and articles from the shipwreck Jeannette) would cross the North Pole).  When, after a year in the ice, it became clear that the Fram would miss the Pole in her Arctic traverse, Nansen and one of his officers left the ship and tried to reach the pole on foot.  Their journey is chronicled in Nansen's excellent book &quot;Farthest North&quot;.","That appears to me as a photo of a painting and not of the ship itself.","<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/national_library_of_norway/tags/fram/\">www.flickr.com/photos/national_library_of_norway/tags/fram/</a>\nfinds many pictures of the Fram, from both the Nansen and Amundsen explorations","Am thankful for these pictures of Jake Stahl.

Why were parents not able to control their offspring? the New York Times in 1903 wanted to know.(30) The newspaper castigated parents who allowed children to demand treats or money as indecent.(31) The police tried to enforce a ban against begging. In response to complaints from the public, the clergy, school superintendents, and classroom teachers issued warnings. The New York Times in November of 1930 worried that demanding coins could teach children to become professional beggars and blackmailers and that children were annoying the public.(32) Begging, decided the paper, was a &quot;malicious influence on the morals of children of the city.&quot;(33) Boys' clubs and other child welfare agencies organized parades and costume contests as alternative activities. As a result of these efforts, child begging on Thanksgiving finally disappeared by the 1940s.(34) &quot;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming\">www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming</a>\r\n\r\nThe tradition went back as far as 1780, involving crossdressing men who called themselves the Fantastics and paraded on the holiday.","Re-scheduled to Halloween in the 1940s? ;)","Really interesting history of Thanksgiving Masking can be found here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming</a>","Really interesting history of Thanksgiving Masking can be found here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming</a>","Really interesting history of Thanksgiving Masking can be found here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming</a>","Really interesting history of Thanksgiving Masking can be found here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-55083998.html?Q=&quot;mumming</a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1235740@N21/\">brilliant  magic</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/972473@N24/\">piece of heaven</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/591987@N24/\">soulful group</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/970265@N21/\">Natural Children's Best Pictures</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","&quot;Jeremiah &quot;Joe&quot; Jeannette (also Jennette)(August 26, 1879 - July 2, 1958) is considered one of the best African-American heavyweight boxers of the early 20th century.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Jeanette\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Jeanette</a>\n\nTom Kennedy (1885-1965) was the U.S. amateur boxing champion in 1908 who became a professional heavyweight fighter in 1911 and later had a long career in Hollywood as an actor.\n<a href=\"http://cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/kennedy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/kennedy.htm</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=7901760\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=7901760</a>\nfimography: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448366/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.imdb.com/name/nm0448366/</a>","The surname is spelled correctly on the photograph and incorrectly on the header.

During the thirty years of her professional life, she was associated with the New England Hospital for Women and Children of Boston.&quot;\r\n\r\nUlrich also gives some details of Hobart's career:\r\n\r\nHobart began her professional life at the famous New York Infirmary for Women and Children, founded by Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman in the United States to graduate from medical school. Blackwell had hoped that other women might follow in her footsteps, but when established medical colleges, including her own alma mater, Geneva College, closed their doors to female students, she was forced to open her own. Thanks to Blackwell's efforts and those of others like her, female physicians comprised about 5 percent of the profession in the late nineteenth century, a figure that changed little until the 1960s.\r\n\r\nMary Hobart spent the remainder of her professional life at another landmark institution: the New England Hospital, founded in 1862 by Dr. Marie Zakrzewska, was the second hospital in the United States run by women for women. Unabashedly separatist, it survived into the middle of the twentieth century, simultaneously committed to high professional standards and to female control.\r\n\r\nThe year Mary Hobart received the diary was an important one for the female physicians of Boston. On June 10, 1884, after more than thirty years of debate, the Massachusetts Medical Society voted (63 to 47) to admit women as members.","Thanks for your comment.

Tales of their extraordinary abilities and larger-than-life personalities have made them much more than just ballplayers: THEY ARE LEGENDS.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1901, 21-year-old Christy Mathewson won 20 games for the New York Giants.

The longest-serving manager in Major League Baseball history, he holds records for wins (3,731), losses (3,948), and games managed (7,755), with his victory total being almost 1,000 more than any other manager. He managed the Philadelphia Athletics for the club's first 50 seasons of play before retiring at age 87 following the 1950 season. He was the first manager to win the World Series three times, and is the only manager to win consecutive Series on separate occasions (1910-11, 1929-30); his five Series titles remain the third most by any manager, and his nine American League pennants rank second in league history.

Many players ‚Äòjumped‚Äô leagues following larger salary offers, fostering a feeling of discontent between principles on both sides. The American League Baltimore franchise pondered a shift in home venue to New York (they would become the Yankees), furthering this simmering dispute.

Baker helped the Philadelphia Athletics win three World Series (1910, 1911 and 1913). His legacy has grown over the years and he is regarded by many as the best third baseman of the pre-war era.\r\n\r\nBaker, who led the American League in home runs in 1911, earned the nickname &quot;Home Run&quot; during the 1911 World Series in which he hit a go-ahead home run off Rube Marquard in game two and a ninth-inning game-tying home run off Christy Mathewson in game three. His home run crown would be the first of four consecutive seasons leading the American League in home runs. He hit 11 HR in 1911, 10 HR in 1912, 12 HR in 1913, and 9 HR in 1914. Two of those seasons, he also led the American League in runs batted in.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Trappe, Maryland, was a butcher by trade, and broke into the major leagues in 1908 with the Athletics. Baker played third base for the Athletics until 1915, when he sat out the entire season in a contract dispute. His contract was sold in 1916 to the New York Yankees, with whom he finished his career.\r\n\r\nInitially, Baker retired in 1920, but came back to play two more seasons with the Yankees, seasons that took him to two more World Series.\r\n\r\nFollowing his retirement, Baker managed for two seasons (1924-25) in the Eastern Shore Baseball League and was credited with discovering Jimmie Foxx and recommending him to Connie Mack.\r\n\r\nHe was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.","Probably from October 1911 (perhaps October 5), according to <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E4DA1E3EE033A2575AC0A9669D946096D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E4DA1E3EE033A...</a>\r\nwhich mentions the Varese.\r\n\r\n&quot;SHELLED TRIPOLI TWO DAYS.; Italians Then Landed and Blew Up Forts -- Turkish Shells Fell Short.\r\n===\r\nSpecial Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.\r\n  October 9, 1911, Monday\r\n  LONDON, Oct. 8. -- The cable between Tripoli and Malta having been restored, telegrams are now coming to hand from that quarter.

There is no evidence that the suspect, Leon Ling, ever frequented those locations and evidence was that Miss Sigel was murdered further uptown on 40th streed (almost three miles away). She may have been killed by a jealous Leon Ling when he found out about his rival, Chu Gain. The case caused quite a stir when the public realized that a white woman of good societal standing had freely romanced not just one, but two separate &quot;Chinamen.&quot; At the time, Ling was the cause of a nationwide manhunt that resulted in police across the US to capture and detain just about any &quot;Americanized&quot; Asian men in repeated cases of mistaken identity. Ultimately, Ling was never caught, and it is suspected that he had help to leave the country. Some say that help came from those in the Chinese revolutionary movement as he had been, at one point, a member in the &quot;Chinese Empire Reform Association&quot; another sibling political organization with similar aims. Ling was reportedly seen disembarking a tramp steamer in Hong Kong and was never heard from again.

This order to build the first British rigid airship was a direct attempt to compete with the German airship programme..  \n\nStatistics:  \nLength 512ft \nDiameter 46ft \nSpeed  42mph (anticipated) \nEngines 2 x 180hp \nVolume 663, 518cft \nDesigns were already being submitted and on 7th May, 1909 the award was given to the Vickers company. The original contract had been for a ship to be constructed for ¬£35,000, however Vickers advised that they could construct the ship for ¬£28,000 without goldbeaters skin gasbags and varnished skin outer cover. The Admiralty would be required to provide contractors for this work. Vickers also asked if they could put up a constructional shed, free of cost to the Crown, so that they may have a ten year monopoly on airship construction as they did with the submarine boat agreement they had with the Crown. On May 7th the contract was awarded, but the 10 year monopoly clause was refused.\nBy 1910 the British Government had committed themselves to a similar path of air-weapon development to that taken by Germany. It was originally planned that the ship be used for scouting capabilities. The project to build the first ship had begun, and designated &quot;HMA No. 1&quot; or more commonly known as &quot;The Mayfly&quot;. The design team was working on something that could match the current Zeppelins of the time. These could fly 100 miles, carry a crew of 26, and get to 5,400 feet with an endurance of twelve and a half hours.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.aht.ndirect.co.uk/airships/hma1/index.html\">www.aht.ndirect.co.uk/airships/hma1/index.html</a>","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMA_No._1\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMA_No._1</a>","Maurice <b>Tabuteau</b>, was a French aviator.\n\nCharles Terres <b>Weymann</b>, was an aviator.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Terres_Weymann\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Terres_Weymann</a>","We'll add these names to the source catalog, with the caution of &quot;probably&quot; until more information turns up.

Formerly only those under detention used to sojourn there. But exactly a year ago Dr. Doty put through a plan he had long had in mind - namely, to remove at Quarantine all persons on incoming ships found to have contagious diseases. Previous to the introduction of this rule, the Quarantine officials had jurisdiction only over cases of small pox, yellow fever, typhus fever, bubonic plague, and cholera, which will go to Swinburne Island, Hoffman Island's neighbor, a short distance further down the bay.","<a href=\"http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~quarantine/hoffman1.htm\">freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~quarantine/hoffman1.htm</a>","here she is, upper left photo, left ship facing forward, James W Wadsworth (named after a congressman), better described as a disinfecting ship, something like the plague would not be handled on her but rather referred to Ellis Island.\n\nhref=&quot;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~quarantine/images/maltn05.jpg&quot;&gt;freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~quarantine/ima...","Sailor Burke was a boxer who fought in the northeast circa 1908-1910","Real name: Charles Prasser","Shadrach Christopoulos: Can you give us a source for your information that Charles Prasser is the real name of Sailor Burke?

He diagnosed the cause of epilepsy and perfected a surgical cure.\r\n\r\nWilder Graves Penfield was born in Spokane, Washington, on January 26, 1891. He was one of three children born to Charles Samuel and Jean (Jefferson) Penfield. His father was a physician and died when Penfield was very young. To support herself and her family, Penfield's mother became a writer and Bible teacher. Penfield spent his early years at the Galahad School in Hudson, Wisconsin, where his mother worked as a housekeeper.\r\n\r\nUpon graduation in 1909, Penfield was accepted at Princeton University. He was active in extra-curricular activities and became president of his class. He was so good at football, that upon graduation in 1913, he was hired as a coach. After graduation from Princeton with a degree in literature, Penfield held a Rhodes scholarship and a Beit Memorial Research fellowship at Oxford University, where he studied with Sir William Osler and Sir Charles Scott Sherrington. He married Helen Katherine Kermott in 1917 and eventually raised four children. Penfield received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1918. He worked in Sherrington's research laboratory at Oxford from 1919 to 1921.\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement from the Montreal Neurological Institute in 1960, Penfield set out on what he called his &quot;second career&quot; of writing and lecturing around the world.

Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock had attempted in November 1910 to fly a plane on a ship-to-shore flight to demonstrate a method to expedite the delivery of mail , etc. from arriving and departing transoceanic vessels. However, bad weather thwarted one attempt and a broken propeller, another. Now at Garden City another attempt was to be made. Two prominent British flyers were approached to participate but declined politely when they learned that there was no remuneration. However Earl L. Ovington volunteered to make the flight. Although he flew a Curtis-type pusher biplane at Chicago he preferred his tractor-type monoplane and came to Garden City with an American-made Bleriot Queen... named the Dragonfly and bearing a bold number 13. Postmaster Hitchcock was disappointed with his choice as he expected his mail carrier's plane to be a two-seated with one seat reserved for him... The Bleriot was only capable of carrying one person. Not wishing to surrender the distinction of being the first air mail carrier he reported &quot;I immediately decided to postpone the flight until a two-seated plane could be procured.&quot; Eventually Hitchcock relented and he said, &quot;I handed the pouch to Ovington ...and permitted him to proceed on that first flight alone. For a time I felt rather deeply disappointed of thus failing in my ambition to become the first (air mail) carrier of record (in the United States). Afterward, when I became better acquainted with Earl Ovington and began to appreciate his fine qualities...I cease to begrudge him the honor he wrested from me.&quot;\r\n     Ovington took off on September 23, 1911 with a load of 640 letters and 1,280 postcards in a mail bag tucked between his legs - the first airplane carry of United States mail authorized by postal authorities. Ovington flew to Mineola, about three miles away, where, as agreed, he dropped the bag in a prearranged spot to waiting postal officials. The drop landed on time and on target, but unfortunately the bag broke on impact with the ground, scattering the mail hither and yon. After a scramble, all the letters and cards were retrieved and sent on the way via regular postal channels, all of them bearing the cancellation &quot;AEROPLANE STATION No.1 - GARDEN CITY ESTATES, N.Y.&quot; For this feat Ovington was awarded the title &quot;AIR MAIL PILOT No.1.&quot;  &quot;","In the hand-written inscription it has &quot;P.M.G. Hitchcock&quot;\r\n\r\nThe letters &quot;P.M.G.&quot; stand for postmaster-general; so it would be significant to retain that in the caption methinks.\r\n\r\nIt's an accepted although archaic abbreviation.","Earle Lewis Ovington (December 20, 1879 - 1936) was an American aeronautical engineer, aviator and inventor, and served as a lab assistant to Thomas Edison.

Cuban officials became worried about the safety of having a sunken ship in their harbor, U.S. officials wanted the remains of the sailors trapped in the wreck recovered and buried, and a few people wanted to confirm the cause of the sinking. Begun in December 1910, a huge waterproof cofferdam was built around the wreck and water was pumped out, finally exposing the wreck by late summer 1911. Sections of the hull of the Maine were numbered, many photographs were taken, and models of the Maine and her wreckage were built by the single Navy employee assigned to the job in Havana. Except for many souvenir items retained by the Navy and frequently distributed to the public, most of the tangled wreckage was dumped into the sea off the coast of Cuba. Between November 20 and December 2, 1911 a court of inquiry headed by Rear Admiral Charles E. Vreeland visited the wreck. ... After the investigation, the newly located dead were buried in Arlington National Cemetery and the hollow, intact portion of the hull of the Maine was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on March 16, 1912.","The pinnacle of &quot;Yellow Journalism&quot;, the Maine was significant because the major American publications at the time blamed the Spanish for the sinking of the ship (it was later discovered to be the result of a boiler explosion, I believe) without any evidence. It caused a major uproar that eventually led to the Spanish-American war and Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders.","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)</a>","remember the MAINE!   surprise? attack on PEARL HARBOUR!   remember the BAY OF TOLKIEN!  weapons of mass destruction-and over 900 &quot;fabricated stories&quot;  to justify attacking IRAQ... remember BUSH!","Yes, the story is still the same!

It is a large stone structure built in the early 20th century for a congregation formed in 1882 to serve the area's French Canadian immigrant population. Financier Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Catholic convert in his teens, bankrolled its construction. The Italian architect practicing in New York Nicholas Serracino, who combined elements of the Italian Renaissance Revival and Classical Revival architectural styles, won won first prize for the design at the Esposizione Internazionale delle Industrie e del Lavore in Turin, in 1911. It is his only surviving church in the city.\nIt is one of the few Catholic churches in New York City with a dome, and only one of two ‚Äî the other being St. Patrick's Cathedral ‚Äî with stained glass windows from the glass studios of Chartres. The building was designated a city landmark in 1969. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 along with its rectory.[1] In the late 20th century the interior and exterior were both restored.\nStarted in 1882 in a rented hall above a stable, the congregation has been through three buildings at two locations. St. Jean Baptiste High School was started on the grounds as an elementary school by nuns of the Congregation of Notre Dame in 1886. In the late 19th century an exposure by a visiting priest of a relic of St. Anne intended for one night, grew into a three-week event during which many miracle cures were alleged by thousands of pilgrims who crowded the church; as a result the church now has its own shrine to the saint, which led to a failed effort to get it designated a basilica. In 1900 it passed from the control of the founding Fathers of Mercy to the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, who introduced Eucharistic adoration as a worship style.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jean_Baptiste_Catholic_Church\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jean_Baptiste_Catholic_Church</a>","Selling medals in front of St. Anne's (1915):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8169423862/]","Must be a multi-tasker -- notice the bugle strung on his shoulder.","L.

We retain the original title of a photograph as part of preserving the historical record. The Bain News Service photo titles are available from several sources‚Äîtyped in the set of caption cards consulted while making the scans, hand-written on an older set of cards, and etched on the negatives themselves. In this case, the abbreviated term is the only form found.","Sorry, but I do not understand the need to title the photo by what is marked on the photo itself.  The photo stands by itself and there is no need to carry the offensive abbreviation to the title.  The title of the photo cannot be excused by the claim that it merely reflects what is written on the photo itself, as the choice of title is the free choice of the poster, the Library of Congress, and as such reflects the Library of Congress' own voice.\n\nIs it not the Library of Congress' own voice when titling a photo that contains no textual markings?  Does it not reflect the best judgment of the Library of Congress regarding the presumed factual (and not editorial) content of the photo?\n\nAnd what if extensive study shows that there exists photos in the collection that is marked in error with incorrect information?  Would you in fact title the photo with the incorrect information?  I suspect not, as it would be assumed that unless otherwise explicitly stated that the title is written in the voice of the Library of Congress.\n\nAnd are your methods such that any offensive comment written on a photo in your archives will also carry the same title on Flickr?\n\nAnd what is one to make of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163954104/\">this photo</a>, where a selective correction to the hand-written note was made when composing its title?\n\nPerhaps there can be a reasonable compromise.  There exists photos in your collection that makes a clear distinction between the Library of Congress' voice and that of whoever annotated the photo, with square brackets used to mark the poster's (Library of Congress') voice.  Perhaps that could be used in this case.  e.g.: &quot;[Japanese] typhoon-boats washed a mile inland at Tokyo (LOC)&quot;\n\nPlease reconsider retitling this photo.  To use such racially loaded and derogatory abbreviations in an area that many would interpret as the Library of Congress' own voice is a very unwise choice and is not fitting the character of such a fine institution.\n\nThough I have not viewed all of your photos I have browsed through many of them and nowhere else do I see a similar offense committed.  This is a bad precedent to set and is all the more unusual and provocative in its uniqueness with respect to the rest of your collection.","@cgfan: LC should probably retitle with brackets as you suggest to simply avoid the debate.  It's historically significant that over the life of the boot black photo, some librarian at LC has mapped &quot;Jew&quot; to &quot;Jewish&quot; (possibly taking offense?), but the same hasn't happened for this photo.  Taking the abberviation out of the limelight of the index title, and storing it in a longer descriptive entry seems like the right move now.  Editing this stuff is a slippery slope, but to my ears &quot;Jew&quot; is more legit than &quot;Jap&quot;.\n\nContrary to your claim, though, there are textual markings on the photo.  The text (&quot;titling&quot; as you refer to it alternately) was scrawled on by an observer of the events (photographer), which makes it primary source material and just as legitimate historic evidence as the photo itself.  What if a researcher is tracking the history of the use of the phrase &quot;Jap&quot;?  Erasing it from the digital database will simply hide the widespread nature of this term, and perhaps its start as an innocuous abbreviation for a long word.  This photo is almost three decades before the climax of the racist term.  It needs to be accessible somewhere.","roketpad: Thank you for adding your comments.  Sounds like we are both in agreement regarding my suggestion as to how to possibly settle the current debate.\n\nHowever I don't see this as the &quot;slippery slope&quot; you mention in the closing of your first paragraph.  The title given right now on Flickr should relect the LOC's current voice.  If they wish to use racial epithets, than so be it, keep the title, but I doubt this represents their voice, and if not, it should be changed.\n\nBy no means does the LOC's changing a Flickr title impact the historical record, which is clear in the photo.  If there were no handwriting on the photo at all, then wouldn't the word's chosen by the LOC to title the Flickr photo be in the LOC's voice too?  Now just because the LOC agreed with the scribe's handwritten note regarding the factual content of the photo does not in turn obligate the LOC to repeat verbatim the scribe's words.  The LOC should use whatever words they feel are necessary to describe the photo.  Whatever words they use to title the photo today is part of the historical record of not the original scribe's voice, but of the LOC's.\n\nI don't understand your second paragraph, as I make no reference to a photo void of any markings, other than as a hypothetical.  I was simply asking how the LOC titles photos that are not textually marked, which I just talked about above in this response.  It was just a rhetorical question to raise the point that yes, whatever title the LOC applies to an image today reflects the LOC's own voice today.","@cgfan: Missed that you were making a hypothetical reference!","Your comments gave us good food for thought!\n\nExpanding an abbreviated word in a title to clarify a spelling can be helpful, so we‚Äôve added the fuller spelling in brackets. But this kind of bracketed interpolation is not intended to replace original vocabulary even when a word can cause offense. Quoting an original title is part of preserving historical context by reflecting how an item presented itself when first produced. Just as the Library doesn‚Äôt re-title books or movies, we don‚Äôt re-title pictures that come to us with formal titles. \n\nThe unbracketed titles that appear with Library of Congress images in Flickr are not the Library‚Äôs own voice. The titles are transcriptions of original text found with the historical photographs. If putting ‚Äú(LOC)‚Äù at the ends of the titles is creating the impression that the Library is writing a new title, we need to rethink adding that indication of where the photo is from. (When a photograph lacks an original title, then a note is provided ‚ÄúTitle devised by Library staff‚Äù and brackets appear around the entire title. There are also judgment calls when, for example, only a surname or multiple abbreviated words appear on a photo. In those cases, the photo may have been given a quick annotation rather than a formal title, and a descriptive title might be devised with an explanatory note about the title source.)\n\nYour comments are helpful for seeing that in the complicated situation with the Bain negatives, where there are multiple sources of historical caption information (two sets of cards and the negatives themselves), varying the title source can cause confusion.

The abbreviation chosen is offensive to many and reverts to the dismissive terminology used during WWII and is out of place in this day and age.\n\n--\n<i><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/page325/\">Seen on your photo stream.</a></i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\">?</a>)</em>","Thanks for understanding that no offense is intended. We retain the original title of a photograph as part of preserving the historical record. The Bain News Service photo titles are available from several sources‚Äîtyped in the set of caption cards consulted while making the scans, hand-written on an older set of cards, and etched on the negatives themselves. Abbreviated spellings are common, and in this case, the sources all abbreviate the word Japanese.","Sorry, but I do not understand the need to title the photo by what is marked on the photo itself.  The photo stands by itself and there is no need to carry the offensive abbreviation to the title.  The title of the photo cannot be excused by the claim that it merely reflects what is written on the photo itself, as the choice of title is the free choice of the poster, the Library of Congress, and as such reflects the Library of Congress' own voice.\n\nIs it not the Library of Congress' own voice when titling a photo that contains no textual markings?  Does it not reflect the best judgment of the Library of Congress regarding the presumed factual (and not editorial) content of the photo?\n\nAnd what if extensive study shows that there exists photos in the collection that is marked in error with incorrect information?  Would you in fact title the photo with the incorrect information?  I suspect not, as it would be assumed that unless otherwise explicitly stated that the title is written in the voice of the Library of Congress.\n\nAnd are your methods such that any offensive comment written on a photo in your archives will also carry the same title on Flickr?\n\nAnd what is one to make of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163954104/\">this photo</a>, where a selective correction to the hand-written note was made when composing its title?\n\nPerhaps there can be a reasonable compromise.  There exists photos in your collection that makes a clear distinction between the Library of Congress' voice and that of whoever annotated the photo, with square brackets used to mark the poster's (Library of Congress') voice.  Perhaps that could be used in this case.  e.g.: &quot;[Japanese] typhoon-boats washed a mile inland at Tokyo (LOC)&quot;\n\nPlease reconsider retitling this photo.  To use such racially loaded and derogatory abbreviations in an area that many would interpret as the Library of Congress' own voice is a very unwise choice and is not fitting the character of such a fine institution.\n\nThough I have not viewed all of your photos I have browsed through many of them and nowhere else do I see a similar offense committed.  This is a bad precedent to set and is all the more unusual and provocative in its uniqueness with respect to the rest of your collection.","Your comments gave us good food for thought!\n\nExpanding an abbreviated word in a title to clarify a spelling can be helpful, so we‚Äôve added the fuller spelling in brackets. But this kind of bracketed interpolation is not intended to replace original vocabulary even when a word can cause offense. Quoting an original title is part of preserving historical context by reflecting how an item presented itself when first produced. Just as the Library doesn‚Äôt re-title books or movies, we don‚Äôt re-title pictures that come to us with formal titles. \n\nThe unbracketed titles that appear with Library of Congress images in Flickr are not the Library‚Äôs own voice. The titles are transcriptions of original text found with the historical photographs. If putting ‚Äú(LOC)‚Äù at the ends of the titles is creating the impression that the Library is writing a new title, we need to rethink adding that indication of where the photo is from. (When a photograph lacks an original title, then a note is provided ‚ÄúTitle devised by Library staff‚Äù and brackets appear around the entire title. There are also judgment calls when, for example, only a surname or multiple abbreviated words appear on a photo. In those cases, the photo may have been given a quick annotation rather than a formal title, and a descriptive title might be devised with an explanatory note about the title source.)\n\nYour comments are helpful for seeing that in the complicated situation with the Bain negatives, where there are multiple sources of historical caption information (two sets of cards and the negatives themselves), varying the title source can cause confusion. Especially when our source of title notes ambiguously cite multiple sources as: ‚ÄúTitle from unverified data provided by the Bain News Service on the negatives or caption cards.‚Äù We‚Äôd better stick with a single source-what can be seen in the negative.\n\nWe‚Äôve started by making sure that the titles for the photos mentioned in the comments above match what‚Äôs written on the negatives rather than the caption cards.\n\nFYI, the published standard that guides our practice in describing the variety of pictures we preserve is called &quot;Graphic Materials: Rules for Describing Original Items and Historical Collections.&quot; It's available online at <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/gm/graphmat.html\">www.loc.gov/rr/print/gm/graphmat.html</a>.","It's a very interesting picture LoC and if you had to worry about every trivial little detail (as above) you would hardly have the time to share many wonderfull pictures.\nI would consider this complaint to be a 'storm in a teacup', even trivial although I suppose that everyone is allowed their little diatribe in this happy little world of PC.","See The San Francisco Call and Post, Aug 14, 1911\n - <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-call-and-post-500-live/156452270/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-call-and-pos...</a>\nwhich reported that &quot;a torpedo boat was swept in shore at Tokyo.&quot;","COUSIN SAYS BEATTIE ADMITTED MURDER; &quot; I Wish I Hadn't Done It,&quot; Witness Declares Defendant Told Him After His Wife Was Killed.\n\nAugust 29, 1911, Tuesday\nPage 1, 3351 words\n\nCHESTERFIELD COURT HOUSE, Va., Aug. 28. -- Showing intense emotion, <b>Paul D.

Nice photo though, this loco is very difficult to photo unless the light conditions are exactly right in the Great Hall (old roundhouse).\n\nLooking at the running board and splasher designs. The running board has 2 large cut outs, and 2 small ones. The splasher shows the name and you can just make out at least the first letter &quot;A&quot;......; the number 1395 is visible. \n\n'On earlier British locomotives the tops of the wheels usually projected through slots in the running plate and were covered by &quot;splashers&quot; which are analogous to mudguards on a road vehicle.' (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footplate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footplate</a>)\n\nIt is definately a compound (3rd cylinder), and most likely a 2-2-2-0 &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, as cited above by Stephen Rees. You can just see the top of the LH cylinder below the running board, ahead of the splasher. (See LNWR Society data pages :  <a href=\"http://www.lnwrs.org.uk/PassLocos/PassLocoP.php?loco=05&amp;photo=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Dreadnaught' class</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lnwrs.org.uk/PassLocos/PassLoco.php?loco=05\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Raven'</a>  for comparisons ). Possibly there were some renumberings, before scrappings, given this photo shows #1395?\n\nGiven that the LNWR was amalgamated into the LMS in 1922, ahead of the railway groupings of 1923, there is no signing of any LMS style anywhere in the photo.  The Clerestory coach on the track alongside also looks as if it is LNWR livery.\n\nThe first coach is almost certainly a travelling post office vehicle, with an offset corridor connection, and the rest look similar but with no ducket (lookout).

Also there is a band playing on the left of the picture.","Most likely the General Strike of 1926, since another picture in this series is dated May 1926.","The first banner is for the Stepney branch of the &quot;London Carmen.&quot;  They were one of the primary unions involved in the August 1911 dock strike.\r\n\r\nAccording to 'A Summary Description of the Papers of National Union of Vehicle Workers' at <a href=\"http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/126vwcol.htm\">www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/126vwcol.htm</a>\r\n  'The National Union of Vehicle Workers was formed as the London Carmen's Trade Union in 1888. By 1892 the union's membership had declined from an initial figure of 6,000 to 2,000. The membership of the union rose again in the period 1895-1910. The London Carmen's Trade Union originally represented carters of East End traffic to and from docks and warehouses. The union had a tradition of collaboration with other unions and in 1911 delegates were sent to the first General Council meeting of the National Transport Workers' Federation. The General Secretary of the union, Sam March, sat on the Executive Council of the National Transport Workers' Federation. The London Carmen's Trade Union was strongly influenced by syndicalism and its members were prominent in the 1911 strikes in London. The failure of the 1912 London transport workers' strikes however resulted in a significant loss of membership from 8,000 members in the union to half that number in 1913. In the same year the union changed its name to the National Union of Vehicle Workers (NUVW) . The NUVW was one of the founding members of the Transport and General Workers' Union and played a significant role in bringing road haulage workers into the new union.'\r\n\r\nThe TGWU was formed in 1922.

While Rodgers was training at Huffman Prairie, he was visited by his cousin Calbraith &quot;Cal&quot; Perry Rodgers.  Cal Rodgers became interested in aviation and he himself was instructed by the Wright Company and purchased his own aircraft.  Cal Rodgers would become the first aviator to fly from coast to coast (Sept. 17 to Nov. 11, 1911)  in a Wright Model EX Flyer named the &quot;Vin Fiz&quot;.  \n\nCal Rodgers would perish in a plane crash during an exhibition flight over Long Beach, California in April 1912.\n\nLt.

He is not wearing white leather leggings and garters, he's not wearing a Skirt, he's wearing Shoes instead of Boots, and the most obvious fault of all is: although this photo states a Grenadier Drum Major London, he is in fact wearing what I believe to be a Scots Guards crossbelt or Sash, (or it could possibly be a Coldstream Guards one,) and is certainly not wearing a Grenadier Guards Drum Major's Sash!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/682685@N22/\">Vintage Camera Adverts</a>, and we'd love to have your photo added to the group.","An American soda fountain in London.","Mrs. Topperwein is mentioned in some detail ( as part of &quot;The Fabulous Topperweins&quot; ) in the wikipedia entry on Exhibition Shooting:   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_shooting\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_shooting</a>","Here is another interesting article:  <a href=\"http://www.traphof.org/roadtoyesterday/november2000.htm\">www.traphof.org/roadtoyesterday/november2000.htm</a>","she looks like annie oakley!","Hi, this photo is being discussed in one of the projects in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/972605@N21/\">Flickr Commons</a> group, and we'd love to have this added to the group pool!","What a wonderful photo!

As a respectable upper-class politician, he supplied a center around which opposition to the dictatorship of Porfirio D√≠az could coalesce. However, once D√≠az was deposed, he proved to be ineffective and the Mexican Revolution quickly spun out of Madero's control. He was deposed and executed by the Porfirista military and his aides, which he neglected to replace with revolutionary supporters. His assassination was followed by the most violent period of the revolution in Mexico (1913‚Äì1917) until the Constitution of 1917 and revolutionary president Venustiano Carranza achieved some degree of stability.

Phil Parmalee of the Wright Company took off at the 1910 fair despite rain and a stiff wind, earning fame as the first person to pilot an airplane in the city. Photographs record flying demonstrations at fairgrounds air shows in 1912, 1915, and 1921, some of which proved fatal. Thousands of fairgrounds spectators witnessed a 1912 crash. Joseph Stevenson of New York City got off the ground in his &quot;Stevenson Biplane&quot; (assembled for the flight the day before), stayed aloft for about two minutes, rising to a height of thirty to forty feet, then &quot;could not elevate his flight.&quot; The airplane turned to the left and then the right before shooting to the ground, motor first. A spectator compared the flight and fall to a spent arrow that goes rapidly upward until it loses its strength and falls to the ground. Stevenson tried unsuccessfully to jump from his self-designed and self-built aircraft. He was pulled unconscious from beneath the plane and, wife by his side, transported by ambulance to the Robinson Infirmary with a fractured skull, a broken rib, and a punctured right lung. He died the next morning.&quot;","Joseph Stevenson was in the news on June 1, 1911, when he crashed his biplane at a field in Mineola, Long Island -- but escaped injury.\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9C00E5D91431E233A25751C0A9609C946096D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9C00E...</a>","Joseph Stevenson began flying at Mineola, Long Island, New York in July, 1910.

The extra pay was well-earned since the work of a coal passer was among the most difficult, dirty, and dangerous duties in the U.S. Navy. \n\nFrederick Wilson, a water tender in the U.S. Navy recorded the work of the coal passer as follows: \n  \n&quot;When on watch, his duties consist of getting out, or passing, coal to his firemen, and in some ships it is no snap to handle 40 or 45 buckets of coal, each weighing 145 or 150 pounds, in a temperature of perhaps 150 [degrees] to 175 [degrees]‚Ä¶ &amp; has to haul the ashes from the ash pans and load and send up buckets of ashes. He is put to work also at cleaning bilge strainers when they become clogged up with coal dirt and ashes. At times he has to put on the fires when a fireman plays out. He has to stow coal in the bunkers when they coal ship. Has to go in the boilers and knock off scale and scrape out mud, and scale and clean out bilges in port‚Ä¶scrub paintwork and paint, clean off pumps, polish bright work, and do any work he may be put at‚Ä¶goes in the back connections of the boilers and cleans out the soot and ashes from there and also in the smoke pipe‚Ä¶any old place that is hard to get at and dirty. It is hard and awfully dirty work and it is work that is never done. If he has any time off, he is at drill‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nIn addition, coal passers were the first line action against bunker fires, wherein they had to dig into the pile of coal, expose the burning embers, and either shovel the coal to the boiler furnaces or douse the fire with water, while living is a mass of super-heated air, with smoke and other noxious gases. Also, in action, a coal passer was in a bad position. Should the ship founder, his chances of escape were not good, and in many cases, if working close to the active boilers, a hit to the boilers and the tons of boiling water they held meant a horrible death. \n\nLastly, a coal passer, living among the coal bunkers and the heat, could seldom ever get fully clean. On OLYMPIA, men exited the bunkers and boiler rooms by climbing ladders that led directly to the Firemans‚Äô Washroom, where they would attempt to clean up so as not to carry their dirt and dust out on the clean decks.&quot; \n\nPresumably, the career of a coal passer in the merchant marine was similarly arduous.","Another Bain/LOC photo of coal passers:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163482898/in/photostream/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163482898/in/p...</a>","Related to this article, perhaps?\r\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE5D81331E233A25757C2A9649C946096D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE5D81331E233A...</a>","The New York Times had a pictorial page on the building of Weller's boat, and plans for the trip, on June 18, 1911.\n\nA later story reported that Weller launched on July 16, 1911.\n(NYT, 7-17-11.)\n\nAfter that, NYT evidently lost interest in the Weller saga.

He was created Duke of Beja. He was the son of Carlos I and Am√©lie of Orleans.\r\nOn 1 February 1908 the royal family returned from the palace of Vila Vi√ßosa to Lisbon. They travelled by coach to Almada and from then took a boat to cross the Tagus River and disembarked in Cais do Sodr√© in central Lisbon. On their way to the royal palace, the carriage with King Carlos I and his family passed through Terreiro do Pa√ßo. While crossing the square, shots were fired from the crowd by at least three men: Alfredo Costa, Manuel Bui√ßa and Aquilino Ribeiro. The King died immediately; his heir Crown Prince Lu√≠s Filipe was mortally wounded; Prince Manuel hit in the arm and Queen Am√©lie surprisingly unharmed. It was the quick thinking of Queen Am√©lie that saved her son Manuel. [1]\r\nThe assassins were shot at the spot by members of the bodyguard and later recognized as members of the Portuguese Republican Party. About twenty minutes later, Prince Luis Filipe died and days later, Manuel was acclaimed King of Portugal. The young King, who had not been groomed for kingship, sought to save the fragile position of the Braganza monarchy by dismissing the dictator Jo√£o Franco and his entire cabinet in 1908. The ambitions of the various political parties made Manuel's reign a turbulent one. Free elections were declared in which republicans and socialists won an overwhelming victory. [2]\r\nThe murder of a prominent republican precipated the revolution that had been so long in preparation. [3] Revolution erupted on October 4, 1910. An illegal military coup was commenced by soldiers who were joined by some civilians and municipal guards attacking loyal garrisons and the royal palace, while the guns of a warship added to the revolutionary colonnade. Three days of almost constant street fighting were enough to drive out the young King. [4] Manuel fled on the royal yacht to British ruled Gibraltar.

Dirty work, and hard -- but it paid six dollars more per month ($22 vs. $16, in 1900) than ordinary deck work, in the Navy. Here is one account:\n\nFrederick Wilson, a water tender in the U.S. Navy recorded the work of the coal passer as follows: \n \n&quot;When on watch, his duties consist of getting out, or passing, coal to his firemen, and in some ships it is no snap to handle 40 or 45 buckets of coal, each weighing 145 or 150 pounds, in a temperature of perhaps 150 [degrees] to 175 [degrees]‚Ä¶ &amp; has to haul the ashes from the ash pans and load and send up buckets of ashes. He is put to work also at cleaning bilge strainers when they become clogged up with coal dirt and ashes. At times he has to put on the fires when a fireman plays out. He has to stow coal in the bunkers when they coal the ship. Has to go into the boilers and knock off scale and scrape out mud, and scale and clean out bilges in port‚Ä¶scrub paintwork and paint, clean off pumps, polish bright work, and do any work he may be put at‚Ä¶goes in the back connections of the boilers and cleans out the soot and ashes from there and also in the smoke pipe‚Ä¶any old place that is hard to get at and dirty. It is hard and awfully dirty work and it is work that is never done. If he has any time off, he is at drill‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&quot;In addition, coal passers were the first line action against bunker fires, wherein they had to dig into the pile of coal, expose the burning embers, and either shovel the coal to the boiler furnaces or douse the fire with water, while living in a mass of super-heated air, with smoke and other noxious gases. Also, in action, a coal passer was in a bad position. Should the ship founder, his chances of escape were not good, and in many cases, if working close to the active boilers, a hit to the boilers and the tons of boiling water they held meant a horrible death.&quot; \n\n&quot;Lastly, a coal passer, living among the coal bunkers and the heat, could seldom ever get fully clean. On the OLYMPIA, men exited the bunkers and boiler rooms by climbing ladders that led directly to the Firemans‚Äô Washroom, where they would attempt to clean up so as not to carry their dirt and dust out onto the clean decks.&quot;\n\nConditions in the merchant marine were similar.","Another Bain/LOC photo of coal passers:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162695843/in/photostream/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162695843/in/p...</a>","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqui\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqui</a>\r\n\r\nSome info on the Yaqui","Yaqui traditionally don't live in tipis.  This shot had to have been set up.  Plus the painting on the tipi is very unusual.","If you view the larges size, you can see a traditional sun shade and wikiup behind the tent on one side, and another sun shade to the right.","I'm with whiteclay, this is not their actual dwelling. The info on the Yaqui says they farmed and lived in pueblas. That was not a nomadic, Plains lifestyle. Besides, where would the buffalo hides have come from to make the tipis? It's a complete disconnect.","But it is so typical of the time this was taken that  &quot;everyone&quot; thought American Indians of any sort lived in tipis.  Just as all females no matter the age were called girls.","Are these Yaqui from Mexico?","From Wikipedia\n\nThe &quot;Yoeme&quot; or Yaqui are a border Native American people who originally lived in the valley of the R√≠o Yaqui in the northern Mexican state of Sonora and throughout the Sonoran Desert region into the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona.","True, this tipi is a joke. No ethnic group from northwestern Mexico has lived in tipis, ever! A typical, rectangular Yaqui dwelling consisted of wattle-and-daub walls, reinforced by reed canes. \n\nThey were basically a farming people, but many Yaquis supplemented their income from time to time by working as farm hands, fishermen, cowboys, miners or domestic servants in Mexican homes. Thousands of them were persecuted, killed, or deported as slaves to Yucat√°n and Oaxaca by Mexican dictator Porfirio D√≠az. Official documents speak of 'cleansing' Sonora by getting rid of all the Yaquis. This genocidal campaign resulted in the 'disappearance' of more than half the Yaqui people. - many of them did not survive the inhumane working conditions on Yucat√°n's henequ√©n plantations. Yet they never gave up their culture and their beliefs... or their land. \n\nMisrepresentation of Native American cultures and people by the media has a long, long history... \n\nThe people standing in front of it look like real Yaquis though, judging by their clothes and looks; they were made to pose in front of the tipi for whatever reason. All the men are wearing dark Yaqui sashes and one of them sports traditional Yaqui sandals, known in Sonora as 'huaraches a tres puntos'. The women wear rebozos  (shawls), popular among Yaquis at the time. This is how most rural women from Sonora were dressed at the turn of the 19th century. \n\nThey seem to be taking part in some larger event, similar to the 1904 World's Fair in St Louis where Geronimo was put on display wearing a stovepipe hat. Many of these exhibitions were virtual human zoos, where visitors could meet 'real-life natives' from different continents - the more exotic, the better, even if this meant using all kinds of incongruous backdrops!\n\nHere is some info on Yaqui history:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sustainedaction.org/Explorations/history_of_the_yaqui.htm\">www.sustainedaction.org/Explorations/history_of_the_yaqui...</a>","Los indios yaquis formaron el ej√©rcito de Obreg√≥n durante la Revoluci√≥n Mexicana.","The Yaqui did however partner up with Apache that lived in the area.

Sopwith is sitting (or really posing, even in those times people were not really flying in costume !) is the <b>Howard Wright Biplane</b> of 1910. Howard T. Wright was no relation to the Wright brothers. He was an English engineer building flying machines from 1907 on.\nIncomprehensibly Sopwith bought the machine and startled everybody when he made his first test flight on October 22, 1910 without ever having flown !\nMachines were in constant modification, so on the LC picture a structure can be seen in front shielding the aviator from the (cold) wind. Originally the aviator was full blown in the wind.\nAlso can be seen a big fuel tank somewhat behind the pilot. At first a smaller tank was dangerously <b>above</b> the aviator. \nSure this is the machine that landed in Windsor Castle on February 1, 1911, probably not in this configuration on the picture. \nSopwith took this Howard Wright Biplane to the USA in his 1912 trip, but crashed in the water off Manhattan Beach on September 10, 1912.

Suspended by the AAA for a year, Oldfield raced in Mexico for a while, then sold the Benz to his manager, Ernie Moross, announced his retirement, and opened a saloon in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nTo Oldfield‚Äôs considerable chagrin, Moross returned the Benz to the beach at Daytona in April 1911. His driver was Bob Burman, as shy as Oldfield was gregarious, but easily as fearless. There were no challengers to the car this time, but still, a large crowd gathered along the measured mile to watch Burman try for a new record.\r\n\r\n‚Äú‚ÄòHere he comes‚Äîthere he goes!‚Äô summed up the story of the ride in a nutshell,‚Äù reported The Horseless Age after the run. Burman‚Äôs speed was 141.732 mph‚Äîa full ten miles an hour faster than Oldfield‚Äôs. This is not to suggest that Burman was the better driver; Barney had typically held back during his Benz run so he could promote another ‚Äúgo-for-the-record‚Äù exhibition. Needless to say, Oldfield was furious and came out of retirement to seek vengeance. But the ‚Äúfastest speed at which man has ever traveled over the earth‚Äôs surface‚Äù belonged to Burman for eight years. So phenomenal was 141-plus mph that automobile makers throughout the world were loath to consider building a car to attempt to top it.\r\n‚ÄúMe and the Benz, here,‚Äù said Barney Oldfield, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna warm up the sand a little.‚Äù\r\n\r\nResumption of the Florida Speed Carnivals would have been anticlimactic after Burman‚Äôs run, so it served as the fitting finale. In 1902, when Olds and Winton were clocked at 57 mph on the beach outside the Ormond Hotel, there had been little motor sport elsewhere in America. Now there was lots‚Äîroad races in Savannah, Georgia; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Santa Monica, California; Elgin, Illinois; and Fairmount Park in Philadelphia.

The headlines read quite ominously - &quot;Giants Play Negro Team, Ends in Riot.&quot; The Giants sent several of their players to New Jersey to face a team known as the Smart Sets. When the Giants arrived they discovered that the Smart Sets were not a white team. Seeing as there was a crowd of 8,000, they felt it would be best to play the game. One thing to note is that this was just a small squad of players, and not the full team. Because of that, they were being managed by Wilbert Robinson rather than John McGraw, who may have had more control of the situation. The first problem came when the Giants' only pitcher refused to take the mound. According to the New York Times, &quot;The only pitcher taken along was Louis Drucke, who comes from Texas. Drucke flatly refused to play against the colored team. All sorts of arguments were brought to bear, and Drucke finally consented to pitch if he was announced as 'Pitcher O'Brien' instead of Drucke.&quot; After that, things went smoothly until the 7th inning. Harry McCormick of the Giants disagreed with a call by the umpire, and it came to blows. A fellow Giants player by the name of Fletcher intervened, but McCormick refused to leave the field after he was tossed from the game. The Chief of Police had to come and remove him. With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth, the umpire handed Drucke a new ball. Drucke took some dirt and began to darken the ball, in order that the opposing players not be able to easily target a new white ball. Members of the Smart Set objected, and Drucke was forced to pitch with a new ball. The game progressed to the top of the tenth. McClellan of the Smart Sets took the mound to pitch, and instead of using the white ball, he used an older, darkened ball. Giants players Fletcher and Snodgrass (who would earn infamy later in the year) protested to the umpire, feeling that if the Smart Sets were able to bat against a pitcher with a clean ball, the Giants should have the same right. The umpire disagreed and the Giants left the field. The crowd degenerated into a mob and assailed the Giants bus with sticks and stones. The Chief of Police intervened and was able to get the Giants out of town, and they were happy to be gone. To put this incident into its proper historical perspective, this game occurred roughly a week after Ty Cobb went up into the stand to beat up a fan who had no hands. Cobb brutalized the man and was suspended by the American League. The Detroit Tigers went on a strike in support of Cobb and the American League lifted the suspension. The fan's sin? He had called Ty Cobb a &quot;half-nigger.&quot; \r\n\r\nmore at: <a href=\"http://www.thediamondangle.com/marasco/negleg/nlgiants.html\">www.thediamondangle.com/marasco/negleg/nlgiants.html</a>","thank you for this story artolog ....","Interesting:\r\n&quot;Hailed as a wonder find by John McGraw when the Giants signed him out of TCU in 1909, Drucke was 12-10 in 1910.

The instrument shown is an orchestrion by the German firm of M. Welte &amp; Sons, dating from pre 1900.  It is a Style #2 Cottage Orchestrion.  From the little information seen in the image, it can be determined that this organ was weight operated and had a manual roll rewind system.\n\nA similar Style #2 can be seen:\n[http://flickr.com/photos/34593456@N08/3209365413/in/set-72157612758523280/]\n\nThese organs were usually found in wealthy residences or commercial locations in the US, palaces and castles in Europe.  It is surprising to see one in this situation.  Perhaps a gift from a benefactor?","I cannot improve upon what Welteboy has written except to say good job everybody! You were on the right track identifying it as an automatic musical instrument, [bonus points to krseward for knowing what a Violano-Virtuoso is!] and I can supply a perfectly logical explanation (taken from a Peerless coin piano ad, circa 1912):\n\n&quot;Did you ever hear of the London tailor who noticed that when a street piano came under his window and played 'God Save the Queen' the machines of his operators slowed down to keep time with the music?\n  It took him just about a minute to size up the situation.\n  He Hired a man by the day to play good, rollicking, SWIFT [orig. italics] tunes, with the result that the work of his shoproom trebled itself. This was a natural, though unconscious, result, an instinctive compliance with the demand of the musical tempo.\n  Does your enterprise need a stimulant?\n  Give it some PEERLESS [orig. italics] tonic and watch it brace up. The PEERLESS [orig. italics] is a business booster of the Big Bull Moose variety. It will change the entire atmosphere of your establishment and put backbone into the most spineless employee. It will give YOU [orig. italics] an optimistic viewpoint that by natural attraction will induce patronage.&quot;\n\n[etc. etc. and so on]\n\n[note: when I write &quot;orig. italics&quot; in brackets, that means that the proceeding word, in the original ad, is in italics, however I can't do that in this text box so I have substituted all caps instead]\n\nSo, in layman's terms, the people in the weaving shop probably had the orchestrion there to keep people working quickly so they wouldn't fall asleep on the job! Welte orchestrions are not as quiet as a musical box, however they are also not loud enough to be annoying indoors if you are a music lover. I bet the people running the shop had many rolls of fast tunes to get one's blood going and give them the kick to keep working! (fast marches, galops, etc.) Maybe on occasion the boss would be nice and put on a waltz or something so they could work at a more lesiurely pace for a little while!\n\nAnyway, if you are interested in seeing the original Peerless ad, complete with a nice illustration of an early Peerless Elite coin piano with &quot;spade&quot; style art glass, it is reproduced on page 23 of the book &quot;Put Another Nickel In&quot; by Q. David Bowers. (Bonanza Books, 1966). \n\nI highly recommend this book as a great history of coin-pianos and orchestrions in America (with some mention of Europe, and a heavy emphasis on Wurlitzer products), and also of the mechanical music collecting scene, circa 1960s.\n\nFor a larger treatise on the subject, I recommend Mr. Bowers' &quot;Encyclopedia of Automatic Musical Instruments&quot; (Vestal Press, 1972), and for a lavish and fantastic book on the modern-day high-end collecting scene, with lots of color photos, technical information, and a history of the collecting scene plus vivid descriptions of the original places of use of these instruments, I recommend Art Reblitz's &quot;Golden Age of Automatic Musical Instruments&quot; (Mechanical Music Press, 2001).\n\nThank you all for turning me on to this great photo! I just search &quot;orchestrion&quot; and BOOM! there it is!","I added an entry for Joseph Byron to Wikipedia and will add one on his son Percy Byron later:\n\nPercy Claude Byron (1847 - May 28, 1923), was a London born photographer in Manhattan who created the Byron Company. He was born in London in 1847, his father was a photographer. He received a commission from the British government to photograph the conditions in English coal mines. He then emigrated to the United States. In 1888 he opened a commercial studio in Manhattan. His son was the photographer Percy Byron. Percy was &quot;the premier maritime photography of his generation&quot;. Joseph Byron worked for the New York Times in the 1890s. He died on May 28, 1923 in Manhattan.\n\nWebsite: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Byron\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Byron</a>\n\n\n\nPercy Byron (1878 - July 10, 1959), was a New York City born photographer at the Byron Company. Percy was &quot;the premier maritime photography of his generation&quot;.\n\nHis father, Joseph Byron was born in London in 1847 and opened the Byron Company in Manhattan in 1881. Percy was born in 1878 in Manhattan.[1] Since 1917 he specialized in maritime photography.[3] He died in 1959 in Manhattan.\n\nWebsite: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Byron\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Byron</a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1022796@N24/\">Disability History</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","This really is a good depiction of how women really were involved in the workforce and in large part are what made our country so successful.","It's so unique that they are blind, it really captures two unseen aspects of hardships in America.","Some oddities... why is this the only Byron photo from the four photos of blind people -- maybe LOC has more?... why is this photo numbered 2191-8 and the stenographer is numbered 2191-6, but there aren't others from the set -- maybe LOC has more?  2191-6, as well as the other two blind photos of Overbrook gymnasts, are dated 4/27/1911 -- is this photo from the same time?  why are there no photos in the Museum of NYC collection by Byron of the Lighthouse from this period -- but many earlier and later?\n\nI see two possibilities for the timing of this photo (when it was printed -- could have been captured earlier).  First, the same as the other three, is the Blind Workers' Exhibition, April 26-28, 1911.  This could be at the exhibition, or at the home of the Lighthouse for the Blind.  A New York Times article on page 14, 4/30/1911, described that building as being 17 foot wide and 74 foot long.  This photo looks like it could have been taken in a 17 foot wide room.\n\nThe second possibility is that this was run in 1912 around the time that the Bourne Workshop for the Blind was opened -- described in the 1911 article as well as on page 8 of 10/12/1912 when it was dedicated.  The photo would then be a picture at the Lighthouse, portraying the cramped conditions that the Bourne center would alleviate.\n\nI set out to try and determine who might have given the Welte to the NY Association for the Blind, aka Lighthouse for the Blind.

(the one Mary Wilder attended)  Not long after we moved there in the early '70's they sold a bunch of equipment no longer used.  Amongst all the stuff was a loom for making rugs.  Also there was broom making equipment.  I seem to remember when I was growing up having a toy broom that said made by the blind.  And mom have some throw rugs with the same tags.  \n\nAs for the music that would be nice but I wonder how much noise the looms made?  Or was it just sort of a whooshing sound?","Please be the first to join my new group and add this picture\n\nAbout 'Its a job'\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1868800@N24/\">www.flickr.com/groups/1868800@N24/</a>\n\nIts a job\n\nThis group is all about people and what we do to earn money....\n\nWe all need money and we all earn it in different ways.
