Morse and A. B. Gaines Have Narrow Escapes When Machine Strikes Log and Turns Turtle on First Albany to New York Passenger Trip.\n\nIn the sight of thousands of persons along the North River to-day, a hydro-aeroplane In which were A. B. Gaines and Erwin A. Morse,&quot; son of Charles W. Morse, was disabled and turned turtle In the middle of the stream. Both men were rescued by boats which put out quickly\nfrom the shore, and the machine, which did not sink, was towed in to a pier. \nThe accident marred what was intended to be the inauguration of a regular hydroaeroplane passenger service between this city and Albany. Mr. Morse, who is manager of the\nHudson Navigation Company, is interested in the new project and went in the aero-plane as a passenger. The machine was piloted by Mr. Gaines. They intended to fly to Albany and left the hangar at the foot of West 132d street at eight o'clock.\nMr. Gaines had previously made a short flight to test the machine and had found\neverything all right. When he left the water for the long flight the pilot sent the\nmachine up about thirty feet, then started off at a sixty mile an hour speed. After\ngoing a short distance at this height, Mr. Gaines decided to come down within five or six feet of the water.  In makingthe dip the bow of the hydroaeroplane struck a log.  The keel of the machine was split and a wing broken and it immediately turned over in the water.\n\nMr. Morse was thrown into the river and started to swim for shore, but Mr.Gaines clung to the wreckage. The machine was then about in the middle of tne river. Crowds that had gathered to watch the flight saw the accident and there was great excitement. Dozens of launches and\nrowboats from the yacht clubs along the shore put out to the rescue. A launch\nfrom a private yacht that was anchored well out in the stream was the first to\nreach the men and take them aboard. The victims of the mishap were landed\nat West 132d street and the machine was towed to a point a short distance away.\nJust at this time the steamboat Rensselaer, of the Hudson Navigation Company,came along on its trip from Albany and the two men got aboard and went down to pier No. 32, where Mr. Morse has living quarters.\n\nAfter a change of clothing the two men had breakfast. Mr. Morse took his experience\nas a minor mishap and said he would start again as soon as the machine was repaired.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers 6/New York NY Evening Telegram/New York NY Evening Telegram 1915 Jul -Aug Grayscale/New York  NY Evening Telegram 1915 Jul -Aug Grayscale - 0184.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=d27e8e8&amp;DocId=5135786&amp;Index=Z:\\Index I-E&amp;HitCount=8&amp;hits=4da+4db+4dc+4e0+5c2+74d+764+79a+&amp;SearchForm=C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Fulton_New_form.html&amp;.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%206/New%20York%20NY%20Evenin...</a>","Good find, artolog, thanks!","As far as I know, Lajoie is the only baseball player in history to have his entire team named after him:  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians</a>","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nap_Lajoie\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nap_Lajoie</a>","This one is dated July 12, 1915.

It is due to the generosity of the Fahnestock family of New York. It consists of twentytwo khaki-colored canvas tents. Eight conical tents are •for the use of the staff. Six oblong tents are to be used for the wounded; each tent can receive eighteen so that there is a capacity of 108 wounded. Five hospital tents have a double covering, a circulation of air between the two layers of canvas maintaining an even temperature within the tents. Three of these five are for operation rooms; the fourth is used as a pharmacy and the fifth is for the reserve medical appliances. Three tents are intended each to accommodate two officers. These twenty-two tents and their contents are placed on four trucks furnished by the French government. To this unit, which is about to go to the front, are attached ten large automobiles belonging to the American hospital of Neuilly. Each of these cars can carry four or five wounded men sitting and three who are unable to sit up. The great utility of this ambulance will be in seeking out the wounded at the first aid post behind the line of fire and transporting them rapidly after the first dressings to the stations.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=0uwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2152&amp;dq=fahnestock+field+hospital,++paris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J7aaUPOXEsrCigKsqoD4CA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=fahnestock&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=0uwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2152&amp;...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http://rcnarchive.rcn.org.uk/data/VOLUME055-1915/page130-volume55-14thaugust1915.pdf&amp;ei=m7SaUPv-Iom9iwKuyoHQAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC8Hr2FF7g93Tl9qxfFN0_lk9htQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;f...</a>\nMore photos of the hospital:\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mk4fAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fahnestock field hospital,  paris&amp;pg=RA1-PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=Mk4fAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fahnestock%...</a>","Elsewhere in the LOC uploads (among many others):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2929579164/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4037484980/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083174577/]","So this was the girl in the velvet swing!

This made way for his rise in Carnegie’s steel empire, and by 1897, Charles became president of the Carnegie Steel Company.\n\nThen in 1901, he teamed with financier J.P. Morgan, and combined and consolidated several competing steel companies (including Carnegie’s) in order to form a new powerhouse called United States Steel Corporation.\n\nCharles also became the new company’s president, but he resigned two years later due to conflicts with Morgan and the company’s directors.\n\nCharles then devoted his efforts to a smaller steel company of his called Bethlehem Steel, which he had a controlling interest in since 1901.\n\nA masterful innovator and motivator, Charles was able to make his company one of the most powerful steel-manufacturers in the world, mainly through efficiency improvements and a merger with the U.S. Shipbuilding Corporation.\n\nThe company reaped huge profits during World War I, supplying steel for military uses.\n\nBy then, Charles was very well known as a steel tycoon with a lavish lifestyle, risk-taking style, and rumored unethical business tactics.\n\nBy the 1920s his fortune was worth around $200 million, but that fortune slowly drained due to factors such as his spending habits, a string of bad investments, and the Great Depression. He died broke in 1939.","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Schwab\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Schwab</a>","Thanks to all of you for this research.

These universities wanted to form an association in order to hold a race every year in which all of the top rowing schools in the country could compete. They chose the Hudson River, outside of Poughkeepsie, as the location to hold the race. It was one of the few places that had a straightaway that was four miles long.\nOnly a single race was run to determine the championship—winner take all. An even more significant difference is that it was a four mile long race. This fact set the Regatta apart from all other crew races that have ever been held. It is the reason why the IRA Regatta became as prestigious as it did, and why the crew team that won was nationally regarded as the best of the best.\nThe Poughkeepsie Regatta quickly became one of the greatest sporting events to watch in the country, and put Poughkeepsie on the map. Every year tens of thousands of spectators would come pouring into Poughkeepsie to watch the races. They covered the shores next to the river, many waiting all day, picnicking on blankets, to ensure they had a good view. The railroad tracks on the west side of the river had a flatbed train which held grandstands from which spectators could watch the race. As the crews rowed up the river, the train would keep pace with them, giving the people on board the best view possible. Hundreds of boats, yachts, and occasionally even Navy destroyers sailed to Poughkeepsie, and moored on the sides of the river to watch the event. The town of Poughkeepsie came alive on the day of the Regatta, with parades, bands, vendors, and banners. In addition, colorful pennants displaying the school colors of all the participants were flying everywhere. The Regatta was extensively covered by newspaper reporters, and as time went on it was even broadcast over local and national radio stations. But the crowds, the cheers, the reporters, parades, and pennants were not the reasons why the Regatta became so intensely popular, the explanation lay in the physical feats of the crew teams. To race at full-speed for four miles required such a breathtaking amount of strength, skill, and endurance that it was awe-inspiring to watch.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://library.marist.edu/archives/regatta/history.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">library.marist.edu/archives/regatta/history.html</a>","I think you're right bior, this is probably Jim Rice.

On June 13, 1915, the N.Y. Times published a story about the building's owners wanting to rent the corner space to a drugstore, and needed to move the statue to do so. It's a wry, tongue in cheek story, which notes that after the shoeshine stand was installed to the left of Greeley, it looked like he was waiting in line for a shine.  The statue moved across the street into the park eventually, but the place was not determined when the article was written.  It was suggested, though, that, the statue (in the famous words of Greeley)  &quot;go west ,young man&quot;, and it did.\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D13FF3D5512738FDDAA0994DE405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D13FF3D551273...</a>\n\nAlso dating the picture are the news headlines above the statue.

With its inspiring view of the Hudson River, the studio offered private and group lessons in ballet and interpretative dance. Rasch’s strict regimen, including body alignment and breathing exercises based on her own European training, set her dancers apart from the typical chorus-line girls who populated the New York stage. The rigorous training program gave Rasch’s dancers the stamina necessary to endure long vaudeville days and nights and, later, filming that required take after take.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.dimitritiomkin.com/biography/albertina-rasch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dimitritiomkin.com/biography/albertina-rasch/</a>\n\nThese pictures therefore must date from October, 1923 or after.","A section from a biography of Jeanette Macdonald starting near the bottom of <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=ojOxCgHZLpUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=ojOxCgHZLpUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lp...</a>\ndiscusses the influence of Rasch on Macdonald, mentioning a location for Rasch's studio in the Steinway Building on West 57th St., but not giving a date.  109-113 West 57th Street is where Steinway Hall (built in 1925) is located.

Richardson\n\nLieutenant Colonel Edwin H. Richardson was not a shy man and portrays himself as fighting for years against institutional ignorance about the value of war dogs. Even before the war, he states that “I was the sole person who took any interest in trained dogs for the army and police, and the outflow from my kennels constituted the only source of supply.“\n\nWhen World War I began, Richardson tried to persuade the powers that be to let him train sentry dogs, already known to be in use by the Germans. His idea having been rejected, he began training ambulance dogs, but this came to little because the Germans did not respect “the inviolability of the sacred symbol of the Red Cross, whether on man or beast, hospital or ship.” Also, the nature of the Great War was that it involved little movement, often only glacial change in the positions of the front lines, which did not suit ambulance dogs that could be used primarily in finding the wounded after a battlefield was controlled. Richardson concedes that the “only ambulance dogs that were used with any success were those with the German army when the Russians were retreating on the Eastern front.”\n\n Richardson, Edwin Hautonville, 1863-   wrote &quot;British war dogs, their training and psychology&quot; [1920], <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/britishwardogsth00richrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.org/details/britishwardogsth00richrich</a>\n\nElsewhere his middle name is spelled &quot;Hautenville&quot; and the title page of &quot;Forty Years with Dogs&quot; (found somewhere on eBay) has that spelling.\n\nSee also <a href=\"http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History13/</a>\n  A BIOGRAPHY OF  E.

Probably looked much like this.  In one of her diary entries she says she only had one student that day.","As I have said on other posts, I am totally in favor of child labor laws, but here is another example of where, as a kid in Maine, I just didn't feel like I was being taken advantage or, or that as children we were abused by the system.  Back in the 40s and 50s, there were two times a year when we made some extra money heading out to the farms outside our small town.  One was at the end of the summer picking beans, a back breaking day long effort, and 2. when we could get out of school to dig potatoes.  (even more back breaking)  We made extra money, and learned what hard work was.  didn't hurt us a bit, and today I look back on those times as part of my education into the world of work.  Today's kids have no idea what hard work is (at least in the northeast--maybe they do on the farms of the heartland.","Well said Jack. Here in merry England my first job was delivering newspapers at the crack of dawn in all weathers before school on my bicycle aged 13. It gave me pocket money for comics and sweets and enough to go and watch a football match on Saturday. When I was 16 I started working in a Supermarket whilst at college. I learnt that money does not grow on trees and that you have to earn it. The education gathered from work is invaluable. Child exploitation is wrong not good honest work.","Many rural schools in the &quot;Wild West&quot; declare a holiday on the first day of hunting season.  It isn't so much that they're letting the kids off for the event but they know that a lot of the student body would be absent that day, holiday or not.","I grew up in the town of Ft. Morgan. I had an uncle that worked year round at the Great Western Sugar Co. Until 1961, when he was transferred to the Loveland, CO plant. By this time, kids were not let out of school to work the farms, but there was plenty of kids that worked after school, helping with anything from driving Tractor, Truck, or other machinery, to taking care of other chores so the adults could work until dark.\nHumans are survivors: when your hungry, you'll do a lot of things to get food to eat! \n\nGrowing up poor in the '50s and '60s, in the Town of Ft. Morgan, CO, I can certainly say that it was a different time, a different culture, compared to how things are today.  People had different values.  Even though they were poor, they would always lend a helping hand, share what they had, and checkup on their neighbors to make sure they were ok.  \nFamilies often had several children and, as they grew up, they were expected to help in the family's work.  Kids who lived in the country had to get up before daylight, go out and take care of the animals, come in, eat breakfast, then change into school cloths in time to catch the bus at 7AM.  I usually finished my homework on the bus in the mornings.  After school, there was usually time for some play, then chores were done, everyone sat down together at the dinner table, and ate supper together.  Conversations typically ranged from what had to be done tomorrow, how much had (or hadn't) got done today, address family matters, and plans for the next few days/weeks. \nMom went shopping once a week, and if she happened to forget something, we all managed to get by until next week when she went shopping again.  There was no sniveling, whining, refusing, back talking, or disobeying.  Most people raised their kids to respect their elders, they were taught manners, and learned not to complain, and obey adults, teachers, and others older than you.  \nI would beg to differ with those who say this was a cruel way to treat and raise children.  It was a necessity to survival and gave those same kids a better chance in their future to go to college, make a better living, and raise their standard of living.  Looking back now, after over 60 years, I'd say the foundation our parents and grandparents laid for future generations was solid and sound.  I've seen the middle class grow, and grow some more, more kids going to college, higher incomes, technological advancement at a record setting pace, much more leisure time per capita, until we have, for the most part, forgotten the hard work and sacrifices that were made so we could live this better life.  \nI dare say, if kids today had to accept some responsibilities and had to actually work for all the things the have, they may think twice about being disrespectful, and actually appreciate what they have.  Our species didn't evolve and survive just so kids would grow up playing video games, disrespect their elders and teachers, and do whatever they want. How many kids (And adults for that matter) spend countless hours playing some video game that will never give anything meaningful back in return?  \nSpend a few hours a month in a garden, and you have something to eat.  \nSpend a few minutes a day caring for an animal, and soon you will have something to eat.\nSpend a few minutes a day helping someone in need and you will have a friend for life.\nSpend a few minutes a day sharing a meal with your family, and those bonds last forever\nSpend a few minutes a day doing nothing, and you will get nothing in return","I added the subjects and year the photograph was shot to the tags here. I'm thinking it would benefit people searching :)","&quot;Investigator reports little actual need for earnings.&quot;  He does need earnings to save up so he can later get books and tutoring once he is emancipated from the adults who pay for his other needs.  They don't really care about him or they'd be giving him a basic education somehow.  Plus if he gets ill or injured there wouldn't much work he'd be able to do being illiterate and disabled.

Obviously, if he said he was there to shoot children working during school hours he would be told to go away.\nPhotographers have the same issues today when they want to shoot factory or slaughterhouse conditions.\nHere perhaps he told the staff that he wanted to take a portrait of them, then cropped almost everything out but the usher.","<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0229373/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.imdb.com/title/tt0229373/</a>\nis the IMDb entry for the film showing.

I was only commenting on how people can retain some dignity even when it is bone crushing hard to do so.","Although there is not two sides to the child labor issue, there is the point that if that child is their daughter, which I assume it is, then she is helping the family.

My wife's taiwanese hairdresser who started her business from the ground up when she came over here dirt poor, now has a couple of girls ages 10 and 12 and they come in after school and sweep up, mind the phones etc.  It is teaching them a work ethic other kids are not getting.","without comment on the horrendousness that is expecting kids to work all day, or what I'm sure the conditions were in this &quot;dilapidated tenement&quot;, I can't help but notice the furniture and hardware.

Putting this as a choice between starvation and child labor is putting the point too strongly.  That may not be the choice this family was faced with.

Mechanically this bicycle is much more like a modern &quot;fixie&quot; (fixed-gear bike) than either one is like a bike used today for road racing or mountain biking, etc. \n\nSo yes, if you could get an unused bike like this kid has from the early 1900s and a new fixie side by side, they would look very much the same.

At the one hand it gives you a feel of what it looked like way back: the clothes are distinct.  \nAt the other it is a testament of something we don't like.\nThe stance of the boy is interesting. You can almost see him thinking; ok let's stand here so this guy can do his interesting stuff. The photographer might even have paid him for his time(which would be irony). He is smoking, so it might be that the boy took this moment to light one up. Why not?\nAs such it is just a shot. The double nature comes from the background. It is child labor; in our view this kid is exploited:  he should be at school.\nThe photo has a double nature  because the kid earns money this way and it seems like the photo was made to more or less expose kid labor so it can be abolished.. so in fact the picture is actually aimed at losing this kids job. I wonder if boy would have helped out if the photographer had told him: i am going to take a picture  so we can use it to stop you from working.\nThis is the double edge of child labor. There was an documentary of an asian girl, perhaps eight years old, who made carpets. Child labor. She and her whole family worked,(slaved might be a better description).. only together they could get enough money to buy the basic needs. Abolish child labor and that income falls away and the family has to struggle harder.  \nAnother double nature: The kid doesn't look exploited in the picture. He seems almost relaxed and in good spirits..  But actually in the end it would probably have been better if he had attended school.\nI wonder what happened to him.. maybe he became a great sportsman with all his cycling experience?\n You'll never know.\nA very capturing picture..","The reference to &quot;Red Light&quot; dangers has to do with working (at least some of the time) in an area (known as a &quot;red light district&quot;) where prostitution was common and one would hope not to find children at all, much less working.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district</a>\n\nSuch references are common in this child labor related collection - see\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=red%20light&amp;co=nclc\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=red%20light&amp;co=nclc</a>","garoto com estilo!","Michael Neubert: Thanks for the helpful explanations about bicycles and the &quot;Red Light dangers&quot; reference.

Even if these employees made it through the work week, they were forced to pay money to the company store for food and supplies and pay rent to the company for the privilege of living in a company owned shack. These shacks were horrendous and certainly not worth the amount of money that they paid.  \n__________________________________________________________________\nHow many children worked at the turn of the 20th century? The 1900 U.S. Census surveyed 2 million children working in a variety of occupations including agriculture, factory work and mining. This census did not produce accurate numbers, however. The reason was, is there were many segments of child employees that were not considered and counted as working. Four prolific groups form the numbers that were not counted: 1.) Children that worked after school were not counted; no matter how many hours a child went to school or worked after school hours they were not counted. Many children went to school only a few hours a day and then worked 12 hours. Due to the disqualification they were not counted.  2.) Children working in agriculture; 3.) Children under the age of 10 were not counted as working.  There were a large number of very small children, even under the age of five that worked in agriculture as pickers; working in canning factories counted as working in agriculture (represented by the oyster shucker photo of 'Manuel&quot;; in mines such as &quot;Vance&quot; in the above picture or as a breaker boy; 3.) in factories, particularly textile factories. Children were often used in textile factories because they could easily get around moving machinery. \n\nHundreds, if not thousands of children were killed and maimed in the course of working. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 eliminated most forms of child labor. There are and have been loopholes in agriculture to which children have been working to include positions on commercial farms. These farms hire &quot;families&quot; to work, and even young children can be included in this agreement. \n\nSadly, there are have been some calls by politicians withing in the last couple of years to repeal child labor laws.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/71958988@N04] \nI'm not sure which part of that she didn't understand.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/artolog] Thank you, artolog.  :)  Maybe somebody needs new glasses or has been sitting in front of her monitor for too long...","It looks as if she's binding a sheaf of corn with a twist of straw.","no corn there.

I'll delete it.  It was a nice picture of a reaper in a cornfield.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/toots] \nThe King James Bible of 1611 says &quot;Ruth said unto Naomi, Now let me go into the field and let me glean ears of corn.&quot;\n\nAnd even earlier, before the &quot;new world&quot; was discovered by Columbus, the Wycliffe Bible of  1383 has &quot;And Ruth of Moab said to her mother-in-law, If thou commandest, I shall go into the field, and I shall gather ears of corn that flee the hands of (the) reapers&quot;","Ruth didn't glean corn as we know it in America.  Europeans didn't have it until after Columbus came back from the Americas.  So I think we have a cultural misunderstanding here, since Americans never use the term &quot;corn&quot; to describe anything but the stuff that comes on corncobs.  (that's not counting foot corns, of course..}\n\nIf a biblical phrase was translated to English in 1383 as &quot;ear of corn&quot;, it would have been a reference to the spike on a grain plant that bears the seeds to be harvested:\n\n&quot;“Wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. are in U.S. called collectively grain,” the OED adds. “Corn- in combinations, in American usage, must therefore be understood to mean maize, whereas in English usage it may mean any cereal; e.g. a cornfield in England is a field of any cereal that is grown in the country, in U.S. one of maize.”\n\n&quot;So to an American, “ear of corn” means corn-on-the-cob, but to a farmer in Yorkshire, it might mean the head of an oat stalk.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2009/10/a-few-kernels-of-truth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2009/10/a-few-kernels-of-truth...</a>","really intense eyes.","The very shallow focus brings out the eyes dramatically.","She's a cutie.","Lois Wilson (June 28, 1894 - March 3, 1988) was an American actress best known for her work during the silent film era.

She earned a degree from Alabama Normal College (now the University of West Alabama), and became a school teacher. Wilson moved to California when she won a beauty contest put on by Universal Studios and the Birmingham News in 1915.

The primarypurpose was to make a motion picture of the road as part of the association’s campaign to keep the public interested in the highway. The tour began in New York on May 15, 1915, and reached San Francisco at the end of August. According to the association’s official history:\nEverywhere elaborate preparations were made to show each city at its best . . . . Automobile parades, scenes of road improvement, dedications of bridges and of newly constructed sections of highway, processions of school-children, every sort of function, celebration and activity connected and unconnected with highway building was arranged for them to photograph. \nThe association, in fact, had to ask communities to replace the fire and police displays with “scenes having a real interest, scenes tending to make it safe, easy, and pleasant to come your way and call on you.”\nBetween cities, the party busied itself taking photographs of scenery, historic sites, road construction, maintenance, improvement, and anything else tending to interest the traveler and stimulate touring.\nWhen the touring automobiles reached San Francisco, they were placed on display between the Transportation Palace and the Palace of Manufacturers. After the exposition, the Lincoln Highway Association used the film in an eastbound publicity tour of one-night stands. “It met with high enthusiasm everywhere,” according to the official history.

Steward was involved in hearings by the Federal Commission on Industrial Relations, held in Dallas, March 1915.  From William James Ghent, ed., <i>Appeal Socialist Classics</i>(Vol 8), essay titled &quot;Socialism and the Farmer&quot;:\n<blockquote>\n&quot;A gasp went round the room when the Steward family \nentered. None of them wore wraps, and several of the six \nchildren were barefoot. The day was bitterly cold. Mrs. \nSteward carried a three-year-old child. \n\nThe family history is one long fight with poverty. The \ncouple married in Arkansas in 1887. Eleven babies have \ncome into the home. On three such occasions there was no \ndoctor in attendance. The family was too poor. Three of \nthe children have died. Ora Vivian had congestion for four \ndays before death claimed her in her third year. Mary Bula \ndied at nine months. Cause unknown. Willie Joe was but \nfive months old when his little body grew cold as he lay by \nhis mother's side and he joined his brother and sister — \nthree baby victims of poverty. \n\nTHE LOSING FIGHT. \n\nThe father related his fight year by year since mar- \nriage. The story of each season was exactly like the other \nwith slight variation. He testified that he never drank \nliquor, never kept it in the house, even for medicinal pur- \nposes, and the family did not squander money for fine \nclothes. His wife never had a ready-made suit in all her \nlife and but three &quot;store&quot; hats. She had but one &quot;trip&quot; in \nher life, and that was when she took advantage of excursion \nrates to travel a distance of 100 miles. They lived within a \nfew miles of Conway, Texas, for two years and his wife was \nto town but once in all that time ; that was when he carried \nher there to be attended by a doctor. The general history \nwas summed up in the statement that the family has &quot;made&quot; \napproximately 700 bales of cotton and hundreds of bushels \nof corn in the last twenty-eight years and now finds itself \nilliterate, hopeless and about $750 in debt. &quot;\n</blockquote>\nAnother excerpt:\n<blockquote>\n&quot;Levi T. Steward, the tenant farmer, and his family \nhave practically no education, own not one inch of ground \nand have never entered a bank except to assume or pay off a \nmortgage. After years and years of productive work they \nfind themselves more heavily in debt than when they started. \nThe best educated members of the family can barely read; \nmost of them can neither read nor write. Their clothes \nwere tatters and the children were barefoot in the middle of \nwinter. From the moment each member of this family en- \ntered life he has been robbed, exploited and figured as a \nunit of profit or loss by some member of the owning class. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://www23.us.archive.org/stream/appealsocialistc08ghen/appealsocialistc08ghen_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www23.us.archive.org/stream/appealsocialistc08ghen/appeal...</a>","The report of the Walsh Commission (Commission on Industrial Relations) identifies a Levi Thomas Stewart (Bain and Mr. Ghent both seem to have the wrong spelling) who testified at hearings in Dallas on March 17, 1915.

Here is a contemporary account:\n\n&quot;I visited carefully the refugee camps at Rosendaal and Bergen Op Zoom, small towns which have entertained from fifty to eighty thousand Belgian refugees. In other still smaller villages along the Dutch frontier the proportion of refugees to inhabitants was even larger.  In one place of about 5,000 population there were 30,000 refugees who arrived within twenty four hours. Most of these however went on to Rotterdam Amsterdam or The Hague. At Rosendaal and Bergen Op Zoom there still remain about 25,000 refugees in each place. The condition of these people is most pitiable. For the most part they are without moneyThey arrived in great haste and in a terrified condition pouring into the country in crowded trains and in such carts and wagons as they could find and trudging on foot along the roadsThe majority of course are women and children and there are many tiny babies some born during the flight.

White, a 34 year old executive at a Brooklyn paint company with a fine home in Elizabeth, New Jersey and a young family,  was accused of masterminding a payroll holdup of his employer.  At his trial, held in late April 1915, he dramatically halted proceedings and made an impassioned confession of a double life.  He was sentenced to  7 1/2 to 15 years at Sing Sing. \n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E11FB3E5D16738DDDA00A94DC405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E11FB3E5D1673...</a>\n<a href=\"http://fultonhistory.com/Process Small/Newspapers/Newspapers  Out of NY/Philadelphia PA Record 1915 May-June/Philadelphia PA Record 1915 May-June - 0124.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=6781b033&amp;DocId=7184610&amp;Index=Z:\\Index O-G-T&amp;HitCount=3&amp;hits=1338+1339+133a+&amp;SearchForm=C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Fulton_New_form.html&amp;.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fultonhistory.com/Process%20Small/Newspapers/Newspapers%2...</a>\nThe Gloversville Morning Herald, May 1, 1915 mused on Mr. White's fate:\n&quot;A Rare Sort of Criminal.\nIf Philip T. White, the Brooklynite, who confessed engineering the hold-up and robbery of the Masury Plant works pay roll messengers carrying $3,000, had kited one of the company's checks or juggled  accounts his crime would have excited no unusual comment.  But the fact that a man in his position and with his qualities should engage in or direct highwayman's job is most peculiar and surprising.  White drew a good salary and was a thoroughly trusted employee. His appearance and manner were all in his favor and he was as much unlike the conventional hold-up man as one could imagine.\nHis industry and ability distinguished him from the common run of employees. Yet, notwithstanding he had earned the confidence of his superiors, that his future was most encouraging, that he was not greatly in need of money, if, indeed, he was in need at all, the man framed up a job to rob the two pay roll messengers within the office building, within sound and sight of his own office and only a few feet removed from the head man of the company.\nDiligent, earnest and apparently ambitious during the daytime, White fell into bad company, then conspired with members of the underworld and planned the robbery, which was very bold and certainly very successful. That was a year ago. It was White's first offense—he says it is his last. \nIt is the remarkable contradition between the man's daylight habits and his night associations that astonishes. His friends had faith in him to the last and he lived well up to the requirements of his responsible post. Yet he traveled with members of the underworld when off duty; that is, he did for a period before he fell. No one reading his confession could fail to think there is some good left in the fellow and the hope is his determination to live straight when he is again free will be adhered to.\nCertainly Philip T. White has furnished Brooklyn with a most unusual criminal sensation.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper 11/Gloversville NY Morning Herald/Gloversville NY Morning Herald 1915 Grayscale/Gloversville NY Morning Herald 1915 Grayscale - 1101.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffa6daaaa4&amp;DocId=4761003&amp;Index=Z:\\Index U-F-P&amp;HitCount=6&amp;hits=20f+210+211+365+366+367+&amp;SearchForm=C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Fulton_New_form.html&amp;.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Gloversville%20NY%20Morn...</a>","Thanks for connecting this somewhat movement-filled picture with sources on the strange career of Philip T.

The Tammany Society kept only one room for itself, renting the rest to entertainment impresarios: Don Bryant's Minstrels,a German theater company, classical concerts and opera. The basement – in the French mode – offered the Café Ausant, where one could see tableux vivant, gymnastic exhibitions, pantomimes, and Punch and Judy shows. There was also a bar, a bazaar, a Ladies' Cafe, and an oyster saloon. All this – with the exception of Bryant's – was open from seven till midnight for a combination price of fifty cents.[47]\n \nThe building had an auditorium of sufficient size to hold public meetings, and a smaller one that became Tony Pastor's Music Hall, where vaudeville had its beginnings.[48]\n \nIn 1927 the building on 14th Street was sold, to make way for the new tower being added to the Consolidated Edison Company Building.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall</a>","artolog:  Thank you for your information about the first Tammany Hall headquarters building which is depicted in this image.

Ironically, Evelyn was loaded with cotton for Germany when it was hit by a German mine:  The second article is a congratulatory letter to Megantic's captain by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce.  It says that Captain Smith was rescued from the Denver, though it seems all others rescued were Denver's crew, its captain and his wife.  That probably accounts for the separate photos.\n  \n&quot;At 4 :05 a. m. on February 19, when the Evelyn was still off the Dutch\ncoast and some miles west of a prolongation of the German-Dutch boundary\nline and the mouth of the Ems, she struck a floating mine. Captain Smith was\nin the pilothouse at the time, having been up all night. He at once caused the\nboats to be lowered and all members of the crew to take their places therein.\nHe was just leaving with the owner's money, ship papers, and some blankets,\nbeing the last to leave the ship, when at 4:20 the second explosion came. The\nfirst explosion was right ahead, the second on the starboard side.\n(10) The ship settled and shortly thereafter sank. This was in latitude 53°\n50' N. longitude 6° 20' E. or about ten miles E. N. E. of the position of Borkum\nLightship.\n(11) The evidence strongly indicates and the Umpire finds that the Evelyn\nwas destroyed by floating mines which had been torn loose from their anchorage\nby storms or other mishaps or from rust. The heavy storms of January and the\nfirst part of February had caused mines to be torn from their moorings.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://untreaty.un.org/cod/riaa/cases/vol_VIII/17-20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">untreaty.un.org/cod/riaa/cases/vol_VIII/17-20.pdf</a>\n\n&quot;Service Rendered by British Steamship Megantic\n\n      In a year marked by so many attacks upon life at sea,  it is some relief to find humanity reasserting itself in saving men and women from the natural perils of the ocean. To place on public record an unselfish service to Americans,  a letter which on April 7,  1915  I sent to Capt George R Metcalfe of the British steamship Megantic is here repeated .\n\nDepartment of Commerce \nOffice of the Secretary \nWashington \nApril 7, I915 \n\nDear Sir \n     Your report to the managers of the White Star Line of your part in the rescue of the captain crew and passengers of the American steamship Denver has been laid before me.  On March 22 at 3.30 pm the steamship Denver sent out the wireless call:  We are sinking and in urgent need of assistance.  Although your ship was then 206 miles distant from the position of the Denver shown in her distress call you changed your course and in a whole gale with a high and dangerous sea running you went to her rescue.\n\n     On the 23d at 4.10 pm you sighted the Denver and sent a boat in charge of First Officer Fred J Bard to her rescue taking off the master of the Denver and his wife, 13 of the crew, and Capt Smith of the American steamship Evelyn,  which had been sunk by mines on the German coast.\n\n    I have asked the Secretary of State to recognize in a suitable manner the services of yourself and of the crew of the British steamship Megantic in rescuing American seamen and citizens from shipwreck.  In due course you will doubtless receive from him the material acknowledgment for which the laws of the United States provide.  In the meantime however I wish to assure you of my own appreciation of the high courage of yourself and those under your command and of your unselfish services to the officers, crew and passengers of an American merchant vessel in distress\nRespectfully \nWilliam C Redfield,  Secretary&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=dE0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1711&amp;lpg=PA1711&amp;dq=steamship+evelyn,+1915,+smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xtqtXNSZvv&amp;sig=5X49glx22nQlYMjhVdIYcComBBA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxzNT5LeH6Tg0QHVl6GeAQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=evelyn&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=dE0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1711&amp;...</a>","Thanks for digging so deep and offering further details.

Passow, of the American line steamship St. Louis, entered the service of the Inman line as a British subject twenty-five years ago. When the Inman line came under the control of the International Navigation Company, and the Government Subsidy Act required that all commanders of the American line should be American citizens, Captain Passow adopted this country as his legal residence. He has been in charge of the St. Louis for three years. He was the chief officer of the City of Paris, now the Philadelphia, on her eventful trip from Southampton, in March 1890, when an explosion of the starboard engine threatened to sink the vessel, with her passengers and crew of more than one thousand, off the Irish coast. Passow, with six men, put to sea in a lifeboat to seek assistance. After nearly three days and nights spent in the search, they returned to the City of Paris, which was later towed to Queenstown in a sinking condition. Captain Passow was the navigating officer of the Harvard, with the rank of commander, during the Spanish-American War.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/masters-of-the-sea.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/masters-of-the-sea.html</a>\nHe retired from the American line at the end of 1915:\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70912FE39591A7A93CAA8178DD85F428185F9\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70912FE39591A7A...</a>","What a strange cage.","&quot;Walter Clement Pipp (February 17, 1893 – January 11, 1965) was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball, now best remembered as the man who lost his starting role to Lou Gehrig at the beginning of Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Pipp\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Pipp</a>\n\n 1915 was the first of his 10 seasons with the Yankees.\n\nCharlie Mullen, &quot;Charles George Mullen (March 15, 1889 – June 6, 1963)&quot;, played for the Yankees 1914-1916.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Mullen\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Mullen</a>\n\nLOC, caption information lists &quot;Mullin&quot;  as playing for the Federal League , probably confusing him with George Mullin, pitcher for the Newark Pepper of the newly formed league.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mullin_\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mullin_</a>(baseball)","Famous pitcher of his era, shown here as player-manager of the New York Yankees in 1915.\n&quot;William Edward Donovan (October 13, 1876 – December 9, 1923), nicknamed Wild Bill, was an American right-handed pitcher and manager in Major League Baseball.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Donovan\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Donovan</a>\n\n&quot;Fungo Hitting&quot;, for those who don't follow baseball, is hitting fly balls during practice sessions for fielding by the players.\n\nSABR biographical sketch:\n<a href=\"http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/55c38ae8\" rel=\"nofollow\">sabr.org/bioproj/person/55c38ae8</a>","Same day, with the group:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6972475972/]","Irene Gibson is Irene Langhorne Gibson, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.Charles Dana Gibson.

Wang returned to New York in 1936 as president of the newly established New York office of the Bank of China. During the turmoil and aftermath of the Sino-Japanese War, he was transferred to Burma, later to Kunming, Rangoon, and Calcutta. Following the communist takeover of mainland China and the recognition of it by India, Wang got to Hong Kong in 1957, and thence, with his wife, Eling, to the U.S., where they settled in Washington, D.C. Eling died in 1980.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=_BZbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=%22henry+wang%22+shanghai+yale&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pffcVP3yBu3asATriIKYAg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22henry%20wang%22%20shanghai%20yale&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=_BZbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&am...</a>\n\nA photo of Cheng-Hsu Henry Wang in 1916 can be found in his Yale yearbook, verifying the subject of this photograph: <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/historyofclassof1916yale#page/n337/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.org/stream/historyofclassof1916yale#page/n337/mod...</a>\n\nMost sources spell his given name &quot;Cheng-Hsu&quot;","Nick,\nThank you for catching this conflation of two people in our description.

Cummings was assisted at trial by Albert Phillips of Stamford, former secretary of state for Connecticut (1913-1915).\n\nHomer Cummings was appointed State's Attorney for Fairfield County,  Connecticut, on July 1, 1914, and his first official act was to take up the inquiry into the death of Waldo Ballou. Cummings served as State's Attorney for ten years from 1914 to 1924.\n\nThe Government did not prevail in its case against Helen Angle. For more details of the Helen Angle trial see the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7073607251/\">Bain/LOC photo</a> of Mrs. Helen Angle on Flickr. \n\n&nbsp;\nIn 1893, Cummings graduated from Yale Law School in New Haven. He was elected mayor of Stamford, Connecticut three times from 1900-1906.  As mayor, in 1905, Cummings appointed William H. Brennan as Chief of Police for Stamford.  Brennan would later investigate the case against Helen Angle and testify against her.\n\nHomer Cummings founded the legal firm of Cummings &amp; Lockwood in 1909. He later served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee between 1919 and 1920. He went on to serve as United States Attorney General for Franklin Roosevelt from 1933 to 1939. \n\n&quot;In 1947 Hollywood made a motion picture called <i>&quot;Boomerang&quot;</i> about Cumming's early career as a prosecutor in Connecticut. This was a sensational murder case that also included a dramatic courtroom scene where Cummings had a live gun aimed at his head at a certain angle and fired. This was to show that the gun could indeed fire but not at the angle a witness said it was used. In this trial Cummings also turned around to prove the man he was prosecuting was innocent after he found evidence to that effect. <i>&quot;Boomerang&quot;</i> became a landmark motion picture for its fully dramatic but documentary style where Cummings real name was not announced till the end of the film which starred Dana Andrews as Cummings&quot;  &nbsp;[<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70613FE3E5A15738DDDAE0994DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]  [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Stille_Cummings\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19150302&amp;id=TwMbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NUkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4434,374501\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FA0B12F8345D13738DDDAB0894DF405B848DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.stamfordhistory.org/pe_pdhistory.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.woodrowwilsonhouse.org/timeline/ImageDisplay.asp?ID=136\" rel=\"nofollow\">6</a>] [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_State_of_Connecticut\" rel=\"nofollow\">7</a>]\n\n&nbsp;\nThere is another <i>Bain/LOC</i> photograph of Homer S.

March 14, 1862. Age is given as 18 on muster roll, but Moore was really only 15 or 16 at enlistment. Present-MR #1-2. Discharged by surgeon for disability after his mother had applied for that judgment. The surgeon found nothing to justify a disability discharge other than the mother's unsupported statement that young Moore was subject to frequent attacks of Diarrhea and her claim that &quot;he is in Every respect unfit to do Military duty.&quot; The surgeon denied this claim, but did find evidence that the boy was only 16 that May and had enlisted without his mother's consent. There was also some difficulty with papers signed by a long-missing husband. (S.O. 289, 12/10/62, AIGO and S.O. 242, 10/16/62, AIGO). There is a note in VSL which says Moore transferred to &quot;1st Howitzer 1863.&quot; This is borne out by the listing of &quot;W. S. Moore&quot; in the roster of the First Company, Richmond Howitzers.\nInterestingly, the same page has:\nMOORE, JOHN C. - Private. March 14, 1862. Age is listed as 18 on the mustering document, but Moore was actually 16 in May, 1862. Present-MR #1-2. Discharged by a surgeon for disability, Oct. 8, 1862, although in effect the discharge was for being under age, and enlisting without parental consent. (S.O. 236, AIGO). Note the almost precisely parallel case of William Savage Moore. The two Moores were quite surely related, possibly even twins, although CSR gives no indications along that line.","See also:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6883282606/\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6040/6883282606_bdfa0018b7_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"139\" alt=\"[Private William Savage Moore of Richmond &quot;Parker&quot; Virginia Light Artillery Battery, 1st Company Howitzers Virginia Light Artillery Battery, and I Company, 15th Virginia Infantry Regiment and lock of hair in case] (LOC)\" /></a>","Thanks for connecting the two, swanq.

Kobayashi (LOC)\" /></a>","The Manley, Australia Library blog has an article detailing the highlights of Seizo Kobayashi's career in Japan:\n\n&quot; [...] Kobayashi (1877-1962) had an extraordinary career. He visited Australia several times. In 1912, he served on the Royal Navy ship HMS Collingwood as an attache. During WWI, he was awarded the US Navy Cross, for his actions in support of the Allied fleet. After WWI he represented Japan on the committee for disposal of enemy vessels, and no doubt saw to it that Japan received her share of Germany's naval fleet.\n\nHe returned to Sydney in 1928 commanding the Idzumo, and hosted the NSW Premier, T R Bavin, to a dinner on board. He inspected the guard of honour at Government House. Clearly, he would have spoken English fluently, and the succession of diplomatic postings he undertook may well have had a deeper espionage role.\n\nKobayashi rose to become an Admiral in the First Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and was a Rear-Admiral during the Japanese campaign in Manchuria. From September 1936 to November 1940, he was the Governor-General of Formosa (now Taiwan), where it is reported that he carried out a policy of 'Japanization'. He must have had blood on his hands.\nIt must have been rare indeed for a Japanese combatant facing the US forces in WWII to have been decorated by them in WWI.\n\nKobayashi resigned his post of Admiral in early 1945, and attempted to lead a group of officers of uncompromising bent, the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, hoping to persuade the Emperor not to surrender. The defeat of Japan put an end to his political hopes.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://manlylocalstudies.blogspot.com/search?q=kobayashi\" rel=\"nofollow\">manlylocalstudies.blogspot.com/search?q=kobayashi</a>","Aimee Christine Rochester (1911-1959), daughter of Mr. Richmond Rochester Jr. and his wife, Aimee L.

His son--Cryounce--was reared to hard work, receiving but a limited education. He was married, in Washington County, Ind., to Mary Hays, whose parents settled in Brown Township, Washington County, in 1817. To this union were born four sons and three daughters. Mr. Wires has always been engaged in farming and stock-raising. Samuel Wires, son of Cryounce, spent his youth upon his father's farm, receiving the benefits of a good education. In 1864 he enlisted in Company H, One Hundred and Thirty-seventh Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served for six months. Since his return home he has taught sixteen terms of school, and is one of the most popular and successful educators in Lawrence County. He also farms to some extent, owning 104 acres of land in Bono Township. He takes an active interest in the improvement of live stock, and is the owner of an English coach horse said by many to be the best general purpose horse in the county. Mr. Wires was united in marriage October 22, 1871, with Miss Sarah J. Tegarden, a native of the Hawkeye State, her birth occurring May 28, 1854.

The noun tirailleur, which translates as &quot;skirmisher&quot;, was a designation given by the French Army to indigenous infantry recruited in the various colonies and overseas possessions of the French Empire during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDespite recruitment not being limited to Senegal, these infantry units took on the adjective &quot;sénégalais&quot; since that was where the first black African Tirailleur regiment had been formed. The first Senegalese Tirailleurs were formed in 1857 and served France in a number of wars, including World War I (providing around 200,000 troops, more than 135,000 of whom fought in Europe and 30,000 of whom were killed) and World War II. Other tirailleur regiments were raised in French North Africa from the Arab and Berber populations of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, they were called Tirailleurs algériens or Turcos. Tirailleur regiments were also raised in Indochina, they were called Vietnamese, Tonkinese or Annamites Tirailleurs.","Una expresión angustiosa que lo dice todo, una foto que impresiona.","Genial, muy buena toma.\n\nSaludos","Powerful!","Una expresion que transmite todo..","he is afraid and sad..","Great!\n<img alt=\"Free counters!\" src=\"http://s10.flagcounter.com/mini/ldv/bg_FFFFFF/txt_FFFFFF/border_FFFFFF/flags_1/\" /><img alt=\"Free counters!\" src=\"http://s01.flagcounter.com/mini/8DD2/bg_FFFFFF/txt_FFFFFF/border_FFFFFF/flags_1\" /><img alt=\"Free counters!\" src=\"http://s01.flagcounter.com/mini/Sde/bg_FFFFFF/txt_FFFFFF/border_FFFFFF/flags_1/\" />","Yes, he looks afraid.

If the caption was done years later, possibly the writer knew the fate of the ship:  <a href=\"http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?153501\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?153501</a>","Interesting, thanks!","The Netherlands were not involved in WWI. But it gave shelter for many refugees.","It does seem that a war of words was happening in February, 1915 (where the photo is in the Bain flow), so I think it's more likely that the caption was written then.  From the Wikipedia article on HMS Lusitania:\n&quot;1915\nThe official warning issued by the Imperial German Embassy about travelling on Lusitania. \nBy early 1915 a new threat began to materialize: submarines. At first they were used by the Germans only to attack naval vessels, and they achieved only occasional – but sometimes spectacular – successes. Then the U-boats began to attack merchant vessels at times, although almost always in accordance with the old cruiser rules. Desperate to gain an advantage on the Atlantic, the German government decided to step up their submarine campaign. On 4 February 1915 Germany declared the seas around the British Isles a war zone: from 18 February allied ships in the area would be sunk without warning.&quot;\nThis was not wholly unrestricted submarine warfare since efforts would be taken to avoid sinking neutral ships.&quot;\n\nIt is definitely ironic that this very ship (under a French flag and named La Dives) was sunk by the Germans in January, 1918.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#International_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#International_reaction</a>","Could be.  The entire Bain collection thus far is captioned in the same block printing, so I assumed somebody cataloged it all at a later date.  But it's just as likely that the same person worked there for years and cataloged it as it was created.  (Maybe the LOC knows for sure...?)\n\nWhichever, it seems that the caption-writer was saying that at this point, &quot;neutral&quot; was just a word.  And of course, remember that Belgium was a neutral just like the Netherlands when the war broke out -- it just happened to be in the way.","Yes, maybe LOC can chime in on this point.  My understanding is that there is also a captioin card for each negative that is not online.  Perhaps these cards are filled out contemporaneously to the negative arriving in the collection, and the caption directly on the negative is a later transcription,.","Thanks all. We will investigate.","From what I understand, the negative would be hand-lettered and numbered first, so that the prints sent out to Bain's news photo subscribers would have basic caption info and an ID number handy as part of the image. \n\nWe have a card catalog with hand-written entries made by Bain staff, but they are a <b>subject index to the  negatives</b>, and it seems likely that the entries were added after the prints were made. As an example, the top of the card might say Christmas and below that is a list of inked numbers for negatives related to that topic.  (I'll check next week at the Library and see if I can find which subject card listed this negative and post it here.) \n\nWe also have a set of <b>caption cards</b> typed by LOC staff 40-50 years ago when they went through the negatives systematically. They combined and often shortened info found on the negative, the old paper sleeve for the negative, and the subject index. These typed cards are the source for the current captions you see in Flickr, even with their typos. \n\nIt's been great to have a &quot;positive&quot; version of the negative (the digitized image) and the caption card info side-by-side now for easier comparison. We change the caption titles now to match what's written on the negatives.\n\nBest of all, we can add the fuller names and subject info that you all provide to the records, too!\n\n-- Helena (LOC)","Thanks, that clears things up tremendously.","See the same ship (with the same name) off New York:\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6874650770/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7225/6874650770_7cc5364774_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"174\" alt=\"PRINS WILLEM V (LOC)\" /></a>","Looking at the picture it seems the ship was renamed to make the neutrality more obvious.

In World War I it was the site of several prisoner-of-war camps, including the &quot;crescent camp&quot; (Halbmondlager) for Muslim fighters of the Triple Entente, where the first wooden mosque in Germany was erected.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zossen\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zossen</a>\nThe camps for certain Muslim prisoners were also used to recruit them to the Central Powers armed forces:\n&quot;The Germans had much greater success recruiting Muslim Allied prisoners. The Germans captured Indian troops from Muslim provinces and French colonial troops from North Africa and sent them to a propaganda camp at Zossen-Wünsdorf, the Halbmondlager (Crescent Moon Prison). Ghurkas, Sikhs, Muslims, Shakurs, and North Africans were among the approximately 3,400 POWs at this camp. The Germans constructed a model camp for these prisoners, including comfortable quarters, special kitchens and foods, and even a mosque (presented by the Kaiser). The Germans sent Russian Tartars, also Muslims, to the neighboring prison camp at Zossen-Weinberge, which featured similarly comfortable accommodations. Before the war, Kaiser Wilhelm II had portrayed himself as a friend of Islam and supported the Turks' call for a jihad (holy war) against the Allies. This marked the beginning of a campaign by the Germans to convert Muslim prisoners to the Central Power cause. Prisoners received special rations, including food unavailable to German civilians, such as rice and wheat flour. The Germans allowed Turkish officials to visit the camp to give patriotic speeches and enlist prisoners for the Ottoman Army. U.S. Ambassador James W. Gerard estimated that about two thousand Allied POWs agreed to join the Turkish legions and fight in Macedonia, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg-e.org/steuer/steuer.ch11.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gutenberg-e.org/steuer/steuer.ch11.html</a>","&quot;Give me a light&quot;","Typo -- should be &quot;Etaples&quot;","Thanks.

The Battle of the IJzer started in October 1914. Thanks to the water the Belgians could stop the Germans. At the end of October the Belgians had opened the gates of the Yser river and flooded the area. As a result, the river became a front line throughout the First World War.

We could not tell whether it came from the throat of German or Frenchman. It existed in its own right, an agonized indictment of heaven and earth. We thrust our fingers into our ears to stop its moan; but it was no good; the cry cut like a drill into our heads, dragging minutes into hours, hours into years. We withered and grew old between those cries.\n\n&quot;Later we learned that it was one of our own [German] men hanging on the wire. Nobody could do anything for him; two men had already tried to save him, only to be shot themselves. We prayed desperately for his death.

The Port Arthur restaurant was at 7-9 Mott Street as shown  in this old postcard: <a href=\"http://www.cardcow.com/311741/port-arthur-restaurant-7-9-mott-street-new-york/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cardcow.com/311741/port-arthur-restaurant-7-9-mott-st...</a> \n\nI think therefore that the shooting in the caption may refer to one which happened on Mott Street, rather than the one referred to in the New York Times article sent by lazygardens, which happened on Pell Street.  A July 1910 shooting in the same block of Mott Street as shown in the Bain images is detailed in this New York Times article which also mentions the  Port Arthur restaurant and the Church of the Transfiguration: <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70611FD395D11738DDDAF0994DF405B808DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70611FD395D11738...</a>\n\nHowever, probably more than one shooting occurred on Mott Street, so I don’t think we can pin it down to this one, given the lack of  information in the Bain caption. \n\nBut we can add some more details about the location of these two  images in our description.

Her husband died in 1915, at age 76.\n\nThe following year the Washington D.C. Police Department began to hire policewomen. In 1918, a woman’s bureau was established and Mina Van Winkle was one of four members of the Bureau. In 1919, Van Winkle became the Bureau’s director, with an initial rank of detective sergeant (and, by December 1920, as a lieutenant).\n\nThe Bureau’s initial responsibilities included “girl welfare work,” prevention and detection of store crimes, and supervision of movie theatres, dance halls, and similar places. However, its greatest emphasis was on casework. Van Winkle stated that <i>“prevention and protection are more primary than prosecution, and those who have done wrong should be intelligently aided toward a better life.”</i>\n\nFrom 1919 until the time of her death, she was president and chief financial contributor of the International Association of Policewomen. The organization was disbanded following her death, but was resurrected in 1956 as the International Association of Police Women (known since 1969 as the International Association of Women Police).

Janin, a poor cabinetmaker of Staten Island, was the summary decision rendered by the board of examiners of the patent of fice. Air. Curtiss began experimenting with a canoe device in 1910. In the controversy that followed the use of the present method it came out that Mr. Janin had really produced the successful device in 1909, but that his poverty prevented him from testing his plans with an actual aeroplane. It is now shown that Janin endured hardships and ridicule and in the years he was working on his water flyer he was made the butt of many who looked upon him as unbalanced by one idea. Mr. Janin's victory will probably make him wealthy immediately, as an order from one of the European belligerents for 200 hydro-aeroplanes is awaiting any manufacturer who is willing to furnish security that they can be delivered. Lawyers for Mr. Curtiss, it is learned, had decided to appeal the case to the Commissioner of Patents, and further to the United States Court of Appeals, if the Commissioner sustains the examiners' decision.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1915-02-14/ed-1/seq-65/\" rel=\"nofollow\">oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1915-02-14/ed-1/se...</a>","B-59:  Thanks for pointing us to more information about Janin in the Sunday Oregonian.

Located first in the old Providence Hospital at 4th Avenue and Madison Street (the present-day site of Seattle’s federal courthouse), and later in a large building near the corner of Rainier and Dearborn Avenues, the Hotel de Gink was a bustling endeavor, lively and as novel as its name implies. \n\n“Gink” was hobo slang meaning “guy” or “fellow.” The hobo history Knights of the Road recognizes the term as an appellation for fellow hoboes and defines it as a “poor unfortunate.&quot; The hotels were the brainchild of Jeff Davis, one of many to be proclaimed “King of the Hoboes.&quot; who organized the International Itinerant Workers (IIW), a short-lived labor union more popularly known as the “Hoboes of America.&quot; The IIW was a self-consciously patriotic response to the more politically radical Wobblies, or IWW – Industrial Workers of the World.&quot; \n<a href=\"http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=3849\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;...</a>","Times account of grand opening of New York Hotel de Gink at Worth and Centre Streets, on 1/21/15, with this headline:\n&quot;HOTEL DE GINK OPENS IN A BLAZE OF GLORY; City Officials and Others, in Evening Dress, See 'King Jeff' Davis Ascend His Throne.

Five or six hobos join in this. One builds a fire and rustles a can. Another has to procure meat; another potatoes; one fellow pledges himself to obtain bread, and still another has to furnish onions, salt and pepper. If a chicken can be stolen, so much the better. The whole outfit is placed in the can and boiled until it is done. If one of the men is successful in procuring 'Java,' an oyster can is used for a coffee tank, and this is also put on the fire to boil. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that California hobos always put a 'snipe' in their coffee, to give it that delicate amber color and to add to the aroma. 'Snipe' is hobo for the butt end of a cigar that smokers throw down in the streets. All hobos have large quantities of snipes in their pockets, for both chewing and smoking purposes. A 'beggar stew' is a 'mulligan,' without any meat.&quot;","Thanks bior for the tantalizing description of this delicacy. And thank you cwalter54 for noting the spelling error.

The first play he will give In New York, beginning next week, is &quot;Androclss and the Lion&quot; by Shaw, which has not been given before in America'. He will give also &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.' His production of this in London aroused great enthusiasm.

Whitman as President of the New York State Tax Commission:\nBiographical sketch from New York Red Book, 1917:\n\nMARTIN SAXE \n     The Hon. Martin Saxe President of the State Tax Commission was born in New York City August 28 1874 and is the son of Fabian and Theresa Helburn Saxe.  He received his education in Public School No 69 Dwight School Princeton University and New York Law School.  He was admitted to the bar in 1897.\n     In 1902 Mr Saxe was appointed Assistant Corporation Counsel in charge of the Bureau for the Collection of Arrears of Personal Taxes of the Law Department of the City of New York.  In 1904 he was elected to the State Senate from the Seventeenth Senate District and in 1906 he was re elected from the Eighteenth Senate District.  During his four years service in the Senate Mr. Saxe was a member of the Committee on Taxation and was also a member of the Special Tax Commission of 1906.\n      Mr. Saxe was elected to the Constitutional Convention of 1915 from the Eighteenth Senate District and was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Taxation of that body by President Elihu Root.  In the early part of that year he assisted in the preparation of the bill for the establishment of the State Tax Department and after the passage of that law was appointed President of the State Tax Commission by Governor Whitman.\n      Mr Saxe is a co author of Powell's Taxation of Corporations He introduced the net earnings rule in this State now widely used in the valuation of special franchises for purposes of taxation.  This rule was first applied by Commissioner Saxe sitting as referee in certiorari proceedings to review the special franchises of the Brooklyn Queens County and Suburban Railroad and the Brooklyn City Railroad, and followed by the referee in the Jamaica Water Supply case, now the leading case on this subject.  Opinion reported in New York Law Journal March 5 1907.\n      He is a member of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the New York County Lawyers Association, the International Law Society, the National Tax Association and the Lotos, Princeton, Lawyers', Republican and Columbia Yacht Clubs.\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=l3FIAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;ots=f5HoH5GzwW&amp;dq=senator martin saxe&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q=senator martin saxe&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=l3FIAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;o...</a>","<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=SjXLZWQWqkkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Alexander+Vouros&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=txPGfNQxaF&amp;sig=aJQTA8fVVfFaNSxzTiVIj6V9G1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tFwQT56RMYGSiQKrq8jNDQ&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander Vouros&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a book on Greek politics</a> referring to Alexander Vouros as the &quot;Greek chargé in Washington&quot;.","VOUROS Alexander 1871-1959 was great diplomat.

That combination was irresistible to Hammerstein, and, although Miss Davies had never before been on the stage, he engaged her at a large salary, and gave her prominence over a half-dozen seasoned and popular veterans on the bill.\n\nMiss Davies had no further contribution to offer art. apparently, than the curves which had gained her success in the pose of &quot;Innocence.&quot; A platform, velvet curtains and a pink union suit were her other accoutrements. Thus equipped, Mr. Hammerstein bade her to sprawl twice a day upon the carpeted floor of the platform, in a series of misnamed poses under the guise of art, and to call at the manager's office Saturday night for her hire.\n\nThere were unholy and unregenerate persons in the audience whose appreciation of art was not so keen as Mr. Hammerstein's, and they displayed a tendency to snicker at the ever broad\nening revelations of the model, as she struck first one, and then another position best calculated to exhibit her charms. It was, therefore, in sight of an audience almost on the verge of an outbreak that Miss Davies, in one of her most generous poses, was horrorstricken by the appearance of a mouse that had wandered from his hidingplace to the platform, quite unmindful that he was menacing the cause of uplift.\n\nThere was a moment of awful suspense, suffered most intensely by the model. It was her duty to be statuesque, but the quiver that ran over her frame showed its undulations even through the union suit. Her attitude—that of a Roman maiden gazing into a bath—was not one to make escape easy.\n\nThe mouse crept nearer, and again the wavy motion of the union suit betrayed Miss Davies' emotion. He gathered himself together is if to spring; the statue began to wobble, when— Excelsior!—from the wings came Loney Haskell, the Victoria's general factotum and handy man, armed with a broom, and the rascally rodent fled. The velvet curtains were drawn amid thunders of applause.\n\nArt had triumphed again at Hammerstein's.\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qX8hAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=qX8hAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onep...</a>","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/76016463@N00] Absolutely worthy of a Wikipedia entry, I say.

Miss Charlotte Davies was my great grandmother.  \nI wish to include more information about my gr grandmother.  She was married very young and had one daughter, Jewell.  Charlotte's husband left her as a single mother in her late teenage years. I know of Charlotte's extreme devotion to her daughter (my grandmother).  My grandmother deeply loved her mother and was raised with honor and access to a wonderful life where she found love, marriage, a beautiful home and family with two sons, George Carter (my father) and Ken Carter  (my uncle).  I have learned of the struggles a single mother faced during those days and I understand Charlotte was a strong survivor and did all she could to provide a very safe/secure life for Jewell. Charlotte was very beautiful and like many women in our history.......this became an asset to acquire money through film and photography.  I understand these photos of Charlotte would be considered in poor taste (an understatement) during those times. However, Charlotte had great pride and integrity.  She was exceptionally smart and had tremendous charm and high personal integrity with class.  These photos should not be a reflection of the true personality of Charlotte, but a reflection of the times and the plight of single mothers/women.  I wish more people knew the true story of Charlotte.  This would be an opportunity to gain insight of those times in society and the fight many women endured.\nJulie Carter-Williams","That is fascinating information, thank you both.
