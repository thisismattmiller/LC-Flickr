This style, popular from about 1930 until 1941, was derived from the pioneering work of industrial designers such as Norman Bel Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss, and Raymond Loewy. The primary elements of the style were the extensive use of new materials, such as aluminum, stainless steel, and synthetics; the absence of superfluous ornament; the suppression of functional demands beneath an encompassing shell; and the extensive use of streamlining, especially in buildings associated with transportation. The depot is an island-type bus station which was built in 1938-1939. The building has a full basement with reinforced concrete foundations and a structural steel framework supporting its main level. George D. Brown, the architect of the Columbia Bus Depot, used design motifs introduced by the industrial designer Raymond Loewy. Loewy had prepared designs for Greyhound from 1933, and was responsible for the blue and ivory color scheme, the stainless steel trim, the redesign of the running dog, and the aerodynamic streamlining, all of which were incorporated into the company image. Loewy’s designs for Greyhound Busses utilized these elements. The Art Moderne was significant as a symbol of hope during the Great Depression. The style represented speed, efficiency, and industrial prosperity, overcoming the economic hardships of the era.

In our story she intertwined the destinies of a young Russian violinist and a New York cotton broker, and, capriciously enough, set the stage for them in a South American city. Thus it\nwas that, in 1916. Benjamin Adler, who was in Brazil on a mission to introduce cotton there when that city was suffering a cotton famine, met Mischa Violin quite by chance in a music store, and began a conversation that eventually resulted in Mr. Adler's assuming the managership of the young Russian violinist. Mr. Adler recognized the boy's great talent after a single hearing, and decided to launch him as a concert artist in North America. All of which explains the fact that Mischa is to give his first Carnegie Hall recital on October 3 under the management of\nBenjamin Adler and that he is to have as his accompanist Mr. Adler's brother, Josef. While Fate may be said to have been instrumental In Mr. Adler's &quot;discovery'' of the young violinist, it is\nequally true that Mlscha had blazed his own trail from the time that he began to stutfy at the age of six with his father in his native city, Odessa.  Mischa Violin -- the coincidence of the\nboy's name and profession may be another of Fate's caprices -- played a concert in Odessa at the age of seven, and attracted the notice of Alexander Fiedmann, the Berlin pedagogue, who\nsent for him later and accepted him as a pupil in the Stern Conservatory.  There his talent was commented upon\nby Adoff Brodaky, Gustav Hollonder, Artur Nlkisch, Godowsky, Safonoff,  Leopold Schmitt, Oscar Bie, and other celebrities. At thirteen he graduated with the highest honors, receiving\nthe gold medal.\nOn Sept. 20. 1913 -- the boy was twelve years old at the time -- we find him giving a concert in Berlin with the Philharmonic Orchestra and playing the Tschaikowsky Concerto, the\nSpohr No. 7 and the Symphonle Espagnole. The following year found him on the books of the Wolff Bureau in Germany, and with the Vert Concert Agency in England. In June 1914, he played at a charity concert in Marlborough Hall, London, and at\nBuckingham Palace. He gave two recitals in London, and fulfilled a number of engagements in Belfast,\nDublin and Glasgow.&quot;","A 1930 brochure for the Radio City Music Hall names Mischa Violin as an Associate Conductor.  \nSee <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/radiocitytheatre00roth\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.org/details/radiocitytheatre00roth</a> (final page with text)","Mischa Elman! ....famous violinist!","Not Mischa Elman (1891-1967), but Mischa Violin (1899–1984), Russian violinist. \n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2138580/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.imdb.com/name/nm2138580/</a>\n\nA photo from 1939 is in <a href=\"https://outlet.historicimages.com/products/neny05056\" rel=\"nofollow\">outlet.historicimages.com/products/neny05056</a> with the caption:\n&quot;Three generations of violinists are represented in the family of Mischa Violin, virtuoso and conductor.

He'd join the Army Air Service in 1924, and would begin military flight training in March of that year.\n\nHere's the other aforementioned photo\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/41140546910]","This is evidence of someone not knowing their history, posting photographs.","There does seem to be a date discrepancy, which is not totally unexpected in the Bain News Photo collection. In general, dates found on the negatives can mean one of several things: they sometimes indicate when the photos were taken, but they can also refer to a later time, such as the date the photo was added to the Bain photo stock, or, sent out to subscribers of the Bain News photo service. In this case, however, the date range for the negatives, which we are loading in sequence by negative number, seems too early. It may be that Bain sometimes inserted a more recent negative in an earlier range or reused a negative number, though it seems unlikely that he would have had reason to file a photo of Charles Lindbergh much before 1922.  \n\nWe have at least one photo of Lindbergh that shows him ca. 1923: <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b09833\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b09833</a> -- certainly a youthful face there!  (I'll note that we have an even more youthful depiction, showing him as a child in a sailor suit,  just barely visible, leaning against his father at the opening of the 60th Congress, in which his father served: Bring up the tiff file and look towards the rear rows in the center of this photo: <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3c29715\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3c29715</a>.)\n\nWe'll adjust the estimated date in the description and continue to ponder some of the mysteries of Bain's negative numbering practices.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/barbara_loc] Often the larger date discrepancies are in photos high in the secondary numerical sequence (the number after the dash). This one has an A added, which is also a clue.  More commonly the discrepancies happen from numbers in the teens, maybe 12 and up.\nPerhaps the negatives were stored in catalog drawers by the primary number to the left of the dash.  In cases where that series didn't fill the drawer, later pictures could have been added at the back of the drawer to fill them and avoid getting new cabinets, especially if there were only a relatively small number of glass negatives left in the collection at the time they started the practice?","New York Aquarium at Castle Garden in the foreground <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/12456197@N03/2313625981/in/photolist-4wrWp8-4wh1cW-6y8wri-oBDjuv-4Vvr4E-6ycF23-6y8yZ6-8JdKoH-cB5MHq-6y8vT6-6i3u2c-9KdKZG-6ycFQb-AhGaP-98hDVs-6y8ssX-6ycHru-7K6iTs-iYikmo-aPpk1T-pizgD1-jSToRi-TQzPfj-75Vd1a-8sB1YA-qBi2zn-fr3Br-pe18sj-FnhSUu-22jUmM1-SdrxRZ-6y8wyc-6y8ujK-6ycHvs-h85tAt-6y8xGa-97nHYU-6ycBBU-6y8vme-Yu8TmS-6HXkV4-6y8u7c-ebG3Bb-6ycHCj-5mqsCJ-bsNQ4L-6ZgiFc-6ycEYm-a1o735-6ycAEj\" title=\"Castle Garden, New York, 1902\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2050/2313625981_60625ed305.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"379\" alt=\"Castle Garden, New York, 1902\" /></a>","<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%c2%b042'12.6&quot;N+74%c2%b001'00.5&quot;W/@40.6995178,-74.022382,254a,35y,54.19h,78.99t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d40.7035!4d-74.0168?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google aerial view</a>","East Potomac Park (including Hains Point) are captured in the center of the photo.

This series was a best-of-nine series, like the first World Series in 1903 and the World Series of 1919 and 1921. The only World Series triple play, the first World Series grand slam and the first World Series home run by a pitcher all occurred in Game 5 of this Series.

At the age of 17, she moved from her family’s farm, upstate along the Hudson River, and made New York City her home. She went to teach school and study for a medical career.\n Clemme Ellis became friends with Sidney and Emma Whittemore and soon started preaching the gospel one night a week at the Door of Hope Mission. While doing this, she heard the voice of God, gave up her plans for a medical career, and took charge of the West Side Gospel Mission in Manhattan’s Theater District. She conducted open-air street meetings and preached the gospel in the mission’s chapel services, all at a time when most young girls were steered away from that kind of Christian service.\n One night, in a street meeting, her speaking attracted the attention of Harry C. White, a salesman who had strayed from God. He followed Clemme back to the mission. He made a commitment to Christ and eventually became the assistant superintendent of the mission. Somewhere along the way, he married Clemme.\n Clemme Ellis White was elected secretary of the IUGM in 1919 and served as the only woman on the executive committee for thirty years. Even though there was an elected president of the association, some would argue that Clemme\nfunctioned as the first executive director. One early\nassociation president commented that her office became the center of information regarding leadership vacancies, volunteer opportunities, new mission start-ups, and mission problems. She served the IUGM  longer than any other person, and many believe her tact and wisdom during the early years saved the association from major problems and\npossibly failure. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.jericho-road.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-Volume-5-Issue-1-February-March.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.jericho-road.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-Volu...</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Shipstead\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Shipstead</a>\n&quot;Henrik Shipstead (January 8, 1881 – June 26, 1960) was an American politician.

The Owen-Maclure community used the space for a variety of purposes from a multi-family dwelling, to a warehouse, to a venue for hosting lectures and dances. In 1859, the structure was purchased by the New Harmony Dramatic Association and renamed Union Hall. The building was transformed into a theater and was home to a famous local acting company, the Golden Troupe. In 1888, Eugene Thrall became the sole owner and the theater was renamed Thrall’s Opera House. For a short time from 1911 to 1913, the Opera House was a nickelodeon movie house until it was purchased in 1914 and turned into a gas station and garage. In 1964, the space was purchased by the Harmonie Associates, who persuaded the state of Indiana to purchase, restore, and maintain the site.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://visitnewharmony.com/playexplore_cpt/thralls-opera-house/\" rel=\"nofollow\">visitnewharmony.com/playexplore_cpt/thralls-opera-house/</a>\n\n&quot;\nWhen the opera house was first constructed in 1824, it wasn't an opera house at all.  It was a communal building created by the Harmonists, the religious group that founded New Harmony, to house single people that wanted to come and live in the Harmonist utopia.  The building was the fourth such communal building, and the last building that the Harmonists built in New Harmony before selling the town and moving out to Pennsylvania.  Over the next few decades, the building housed a number of different businesses, including a Sunday school, a store, and a warehouse.  In 1859 it was purchased by the New Harmony Dramatic Association for use as a theater and dance hall.  Various theatrical groups, like New Harmony's famous Golden Troupe, used the theater to stage their productions.  \nEugene S. Thrall, a man who had been co-owner of the building since 1867, bought out the rest of it in 1888 and remolded the front, adding the opera house styled facade you see today.  He also changed the name of the building to Thrall's Opera House.  It was used as an opera house until 1910, after which it was used the next few decades as a nickelodeon movie house and a Conoco gas station.  In 1964 the Indiana Department of Natural Resources bought the building, thanks to the efforts of the Harmonie Associates, renovated it to be used as a theater once again.  Thrall's Opera House still hosts various musical productions on its stage, as well as workshops, lectures, and balls.  Visitors can go to the opera house and marvel at the style of its auditorium room, which harkens back to late 19th-century America.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=23565\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=23565</a>","What an interesting history!

(Spoiler alert: He lives!) Before two weeks of performing at Keith’s Theater on Washington Street, the master of the “Impossible Possible” decided to take his talent of escaping from handcuffs and chains a step further by doing so underwater.\n\n&quot;Houdini stood at the edge of the Harvard Bridge—commonly referred to as the Mass. Ave. Bridge—and was shackled by a Boston patrolman. His hands were handcuffed behind his back and chained to a collar around his neck. According to a <i>Boston Globe</i> article chronicling the feat, a signal was tooted from a towboat, and Houdini went overboard into the chilly waters below.\n\n&quot;'There is always the possibility that I will be unable to free myself, as one never can tell what will happen to a lock,' Houdini told the newspaper. 'However, I am a good swimmer, have confidence in myself, and I hope to perform this feat successfully.'\n\n&quot;The <i>Globe</i> estimated some 20,000 spectators gathered to see Houdini’s leap, including the mayors of Boston and Cambridge. They waited 40 seconds for the magician to resurface, which he did with the shackles in his hands.\n\n&quot;A <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxvesperis/2512075625/\">plaque</a> commemorating Houdini’s jump is situated on the Boston side of the bridge, commissioned by Boston’s chapter of the Society of American Magicians.&quot;\n&nbsp;","Also:\n\n<b>&quot;Houdini&quot;</b>  c.1910 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; by <i>The Library of Congress</i>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2786279633/\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3065/2786279633_e2e5b0285e_z.jpg\" title=\"Houdini  (LOC)\" alt=\"ALT NAME 1\" /></a>","Amazing muscles in his legs.

When she became an actress in the theater, she took the name <b>Gypsy O’Brien</b>.\n\n&quot;In December 1914, Gypsy sailed as a member of a British theater troop from Liverpool to New York.  She appeared in <i>To-Night’s the Night</i>, a musical comedy that ran at Shubert’s Theatre from December 1914 into the spring of 1915.\n\n&quot;For the next two years, she worked steadily in musicals on the New York stage.  Gypsy entered films in 1916 with an Olga Petrova vehicle, <i>The Soul Market </i>(1916). Later that year, Gypsy appeared with Earle Williams in <i>The Scarlet Runner</i>, a 12-chapter series that related the adventures of Christopher Race (Williams) and his high-powered automobile, The Scarlet Runner.\n\n&quot;Her screen work was sparse through the 1910s. In 1920, she was given the lead with Lionel Barrymore in <i>The Master Mind</i> (1920), a First National melodrama.\n\n&quot;Gypsy’s remaining film roles were small. She was with Pauline Starke in <i>Salvation Nell</i> (1921) and <i>The Young Diana</i> (1922) with Marion Davies. She spent two months with her family in England in the summer of 1922. After working again with Davies in <i>Little Old New York</i> (1923), Gypsy devoted more time to her stage work.\n\n&quot;While touring in <i>Is Zat So?</i> through California in the mid-1920s, Gypsy met George Blankenhorn, a steel plant engineer. They were married in 1928.  Gypsy retired from show business.\n\n&quot;The Blankenhorns lived quietly in Pasadena. George died in December 1956. Gypsy passed away on September 2, 1975. Gypsy’s only living relative, Mrs. Lillian Dewdney of London, England, announced her death.&quot;\n –  <a href=\"https://michaelgankerich.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/gypsy-obrien-wandering-no-more/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>CLOSE-UPS AND LONG-SHOTS</i></a> by Michael G.

His extraordinary popularity and popular visibility were sustained by a prolific stream of essay collections, beginning with Wake-Robin in 1871 (excerpted in this work). In the words of his biographer Edward J. Renehan, Burroughs's special identity was less that of a scientific naturalist than that of &quot;a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world&quot; (John Burroughs: An American Naturalist [Post Mills, Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing Company, 1992], p. 97); his essays stimulate the reader's own perceptions by blending the subjectivity of experience and feeling with the objectivity of the informed intellect and the faithfully accurate eye. The result was a body of work whose perfect resonance with the tone of its cultural moment perhaps explains both its enormous popularity at that time, and its relative obscurity since. Burroughs inspired a host of imitators, some of whom were fine writers in their own right, but it was he who set the standards of form--and of sensibility--for others to follow, whether as &quot;literary naturalists&quot; or simply as lovers of the natural world. This collection of essays about the author's beloved native Catskills contains material originally published across four decades; illustrated with telling photographs of Burroughs and his artfully natural world, it well represents the special qualities of his work.&quot;\n\nSee <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrvg+vg12))\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrvg+vg12))</a>","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossip_Gabrilowitsch\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossip_Gabrilowitsch</a>\nSee <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/17098386501/in/photolist-Smx5pq-Smx5d3-25X674S-GN2DbF-s3VGBg\" title=\"O.

Noted for her large dark eyes, mask-like face and boyish figure, Nielsen most often portrayed strong-willed passionate women trapped by tragic circumstances. Due to the erotic nature of her performances, Nielsen's films were heavily censored in the United States and her work remained relatively obscure to American audiences.&quot;","There are several clips of <b>Asta Nielsen</b> on <i>YouTube</i>, including this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jPI9Ujjd9A\" rel=\"nofollow\">3 minute clip</a> from <i>The Abyss</i>.

Danish Nobel Laureate in Literature Johannes V. Jensen wrote of her memoirs: 'If you weren't a great actress, then you would have become a great author.' In fact, she continued writing – stories, articles for newspapers and, later, a series of radio lectures entitled Growing Old: A New Life. At the same time, she produced some successful work as a visual artist: 'I created a new form of painting, not with brush and paint, but with colorful fabric from which I assemble people and animals, landscapes and flowers.'\n\n&quot;She directed her first film at 86. After a film about her life did not meet with her approval, she set to work on the project herself. The result was a work of art. At the beginning of the 1960’s, 83-year-old Asta Nielsen had to come to terms with the most severe blow of her life: Her daughter Jesta committed suicide following the death of her husband.\n\n&quot;Finally, at 88 years of age, Asta Nielsen married her third husband, Christian Theede, an art dealer 18 years her junior and the great love of her life. The two enjoyed their travels together so much that they decided to leave their fortune to a foundation to fund trips for the elderly. 'It was so lovely to travel,' said Asta Nielsen, 'we want to make that possible for others now too.'&quot;</blockquote>","And more biographies:\n<a href=\"https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/asta-nielsen-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/asta-nielsen-2/</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.kortermand.dk/tshirt/asta_uk.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.kortermand.dk/tshirt/asta_uk.htm</a>\n\nand a Flickr album of portraits, posters, etc. from the Film Museum\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/36461985@N08/albums/72157630867865856\" title=\"Asta Nielsen - The Danish Silent Film Diva\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/7697406672_254ee82897_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Asta Nielsen - The Danish Silent Film Diva\" /></a>","Looks to be a Minnesota State Senator: James Denis Denegre\n<a href=\"https://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail?ID=12527\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail?ID=12527</a>\nBorn 5/5/1868, New Orleans, Louisiana \nDied 12/30/1926","See also his obituary in &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot;, vol. 27, p. 588\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=CRZbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA588&amp;lpg=PA588&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=CRZbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA588&amp;l...</a>","swanq and B-59:  Thanks.

Hahl) was born in New York on May 12 of 1888. \n\nHis first recordings were on 1912 as member of the Manhattan Quartet (Manhattan Quartet / Manhattan Quartett), with whom he stayed until 1929. \nDuring the World War I, Adolph J. Hahl changed his name to Arthur Hall on 1917 due to the anti-german hysteria, &amp; started recording as solo artist as well. \nAmong the many recordings he did on as solo artist, Hall cut &quot;Yes, We Have No Bananas!&quot; on 1923 for Black Swan under the pseudonym of Howard Lewis, which went also issued on the Olympic label. \nHall also worked for other labels (both as solo artist &amp; part of vocal groups ranging from duets to quartets as well as providing vocal refrains for jazz &amp; dance band records) such as the Plaza group (Banner, Domino (as either Allen Craig or Cliff Stewart), Regal, Oriole (as Charles Nelson), etc.), Emerson, Everybodys, the Grey Gull group (Grey Gull, Madison, Supreme, Radiex, Globe, Amco, etc.) (the Grey Gull company used masters from the NYRL group, Emerson &amp; other companies until it opened his own studio on 1926), the NYRL/New York Recording Laboratories group (Paramount, Puritan, Broadway, Puretone, etc.), the Pathé Frères Phonograph Co. (Pathé Actuelle, Actuelle, Perfect (3), Davega, etc.), The Arto Company (which also included Bell (4), Cleartone Records (2) &amp; many others), the Bell Record Corporation (which included Bell (4)), Gennett &amp; Edison, just to mention several of these. \n\nFrom 1924, Arthur Hall began recording several duets with tenor John Ryan (14), beginning with &quot;Hawaiian Nithningale&quot; (matrix 9863 - recorded on November 21 of 1924) / &quot;I'm Someone Who's No One To You&quot; (matrix 9832 - recorded on November 7 of 1924) (released on Edison Diamond Disc 51473), which brought the beginning of a long series of recordings by Hall &amp; Ryan, both under their own names &amp; several pseudonyms (for example, The Harmony Brothers). \nHall &amp; Ryan were also augmented by Ed Smalle when they recorded also as The Frolickers for Edison. \nOne year later, Hall joined the vocal group That Singing Four, which also gave way to the National Male Quartet on 1926. \nHis final Edison Diamond disc was &quot;Sweet Elaine&quot; (matrix E-18188 - recorded on January 24 of 1928), which was issued on Edison Diamonc Disc 52235 on 1928. \n\nArthur Hall died during March of 1951 in New York. &quot;\n<a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/2885603-Arthur-Hall-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.discogs.com/artist/2885603-Arthur-Hall-2</a>\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=-FOSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA939&amp;lpg=PA939&amp;dq=adolph+hahl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cr3W6NTiD6&amp;sig=kywveEgoenSROyRFejQ_h9AMjOU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtnOyvjN3XAhUK1mMKHSkfBcQQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=adolph hahl&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=-FOSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA939&amp;l...</a>\n<a href=\"https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/40739/Hall_Arthur_vocalist_tenor_vocal\" rel=\"nofollow\">adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/40739/Hall_A...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?nq=1&amp;query_type=author&amp;query=Hall,+Arthur\" rel=\"nofollow\">cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?nq=1&amp;query_type...</a>","Thank you—we can indicate that Arthur Hall is possibly pictured.","I added him to Wikidata:\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44285642\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44285642</a>","I am excited if this is Arthur Hall because he is my great grandfather Adolph Joseph HOHL (not Hahl).

She was the longtime companion of Elsie de Wolfe (later known as Lady Mendl), a prominent socialite and famous interior decorator.

Miss Miriam was operated on a week ago for appendicitis and was apparently recovering when septicemia set in and necessitated a second operation from which the singer did not rally. She died a few hours later Miss Miriam had sung two seasons with the Metropolitan and her soprano voice had attracted much favorable comment. Last season when Lucrezia Bori was indisposed Miss Miriam received her first big opportunity to sing a principal role. She was given the title role in RimskyKorsakoff's The Snow Maiden and she handled the role both vocally and histrionically with surprising skill and success obtaining without exception the entire approval of the New York critics. It is said that she had signed a three years contract with the Metropolitan Opera Company at the conclusion of her last season's contract. Miss Miriam hails from Glendale Md but studied music in Rome and Milan where she also toured. Several years ago when she returned to her native country she was engaged to tour with the late Enrico Caruso through this country and Canada. The body was taken to her father's home in Maryland where the funeral services were held on Tuesday July 25.\n-Musical Courier, July 27, 1922.\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=N-U6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA49&amp;lpg=RA3-PA49&amp;dq=alice+miriam+,+metropolitan+opera&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CE5zWaZ9I4&amp;sig=J_awIHfCIf6ozuSa8Z43VUIVlNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSqrObzqPXAhVI82MKHV8xDkAQ6AEIRzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=alice%20miriam%20%2C%20metropolitan%20opera&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=N-U6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA49&am...</a>\n\n&quot;Birth: Oct. 17, 1887\nNewton\nHarvey County\nKansas, USA\nDeath: Jul. 24, 1922\n \nNote: died at that age of 28; no marker\n \nBurial:\nHoly Trinity Cemetery \nBowie\nPrince George's County\nMaryland, USA&quot;\n<a href=\"https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=31260819\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=31260819</a>","&quot;Albert Jeremiah Beveridge (October 6, 1862 – April 27, 1927) was an American historian and US senator from Indiana.

This is the date for the opening of the orange show, the directors of which this year have adopted the slogan &quot;Swat the Jinx.&quot;   When horror was expressed over the selection of the date for the annual display of California's leading crop, directors of the show explained that weather records proved there was the least likelihood of rain during the period February 13 to 23 [1920].

Its personnel were assigned from the American Expeditionary Forces at large. It occupied a part of a large French convent school, the Pensionnat du Calvare, which was suitable for hospital purposes, as it contained many large well lighted and ventilated rooms; however, the sanitary arrangements were exceedingly poor and no adequate water supply existed. A detachment of United States Engineers was attached to the hospital to install the necessary plumbing and to provide a sufficient water supply; also several wooden barracks for the personnel were constructed by the Engineers, and the bed capacity of the hospital was increased from 250 to 300. Camp Hospital\n\nNo. 46 was intended for convalescent patients only, but it received cases of acute disease and of injury from its surrounding area. During December, 1918, only venereal cases en route to the United States were admitted. The total number of patients admitted during its existence was 1,150. The hospital was closed February 28, 1919, and its personnel were transferred to Camp Pontanezen, Brest, for duty.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/adminamerexp/chapter25.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/adminamerexp/chapter...</a>\n<a href=\"http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/adminamerexp/ch25fig159.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/adminamerexp/ch25fig...</a>","<del>Likely</del> may be Francis Emroy Warren (June 20, 1844 – November 24, 1929), United States Senator from Wyoming and the first Governor of Wyoming.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_E._Warren\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_E._Warren</a>","Is there a New York connection?

He was head of the company from 1907 to 1930 and was the last member of the founding families to lead Procter &amp; Gamble.[1] Prior to taking that post, he helped drive the company's creation of a profit-sharing program for employees,[2] the first in America.\n\nProcter joined the board of trustees for the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati (now known as Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center). In 1921, Procter was elected president of the new board of trustees, a position he held until his death in 1934.\n\nProcter's leadership and philanthropy led to an expansion in the hospital's size, scope, mission and reputation. One of the board's first acts was to change the hospital's name from Protestant Episcopal Hospital to the Children's Hospital.\n\nProcter's donation to Princeton University upon his graduation in 1883[3][4] provided for the construction in 1913 of Procter Hall. One of several Gothic buildings designed by Ralph Adams Cram to serve as the new Graduate College, Procter Hall is particularly noted for its Great West Window,[5] designed by William and Anne Lee Willet.[6] Today the building serves as the college's formal dining hall[7] and chief public space.[8]","see also <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/35919427425/in/photostream/\" title=\"Col.

(sometimes appears as Ferry Lulek.\nMusical Courier article, accompanied by and Underwood &amp; Underwod photo, from July 3, 1919:\n\n&quot;DR FERY LULEK TO SETTLE IN NEW YORK\nProminent Vocal Teacher and Singer Assured of an Immense Class \nThe good news is at hand that the list of New York's famous vocal pedagogues is to be augmented by the permanent presence here of Dr Fery Lulek, late of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music where he taught with such brilliant results for seven years that every effort was made to induce him to remain there. However as Dr Lulek also is a concert singer of high attainments, he felt that further connection with the constant duties of so large an institution as that in Cincinnati and longer residence away from metropolitan atmosphere and music life were not conducive to the advancement of his own larger career. Therefore Dr Lulek made up his mind to dwell henceforth in New York and to act more or less as a free lance with his eye chiefly on his activity as a soloist.  However when it became known that he contemplated such a move, so many were the lesson applications from his old students and from numerous new ones that he found himself compelled to plan for extensive pedagogical work and to change his original purpose of taking only a few pupils and spending most of his time in concert traveling, When Dr Lulek opens his new studios here next fall he will have a class so large that the musical circles of this city are sure to marvel.\n\nDr Lulek's standing in the profession is well known to MUSICAL Courier readers but perhaps a few words about him biographically may not be amiss at this time.\n\nDr Fery Lulek's father, a distinguished lawyer, chose notwithstanding his son's very pronounced musical gifts which early presaged a brilliant musical career, what he considered to be a more practical profession for his son namely the law. Therefore after having finished his academic studies Fery Lulek became a student of law. He was graduated and took his degree in 1899. For the next four years he devoted himself to the practice of his chosen profession in the character of judge as well as lawyer. In the meantime however he had been pursuing his musical studies under the guidance of Professor Kraemer and later under Professor Gaensbacher and Professor Ress.  In 1904 Dr Lulek went to Paris to take up his studies with Sbriglia, the well known Italian teacher of De Reszke, Plançon,  etc and since that time he has devoted himself entirely to music having appeared with flattering success both as a concert and oratorio singer in all the leading cities of France, England, Belgium, Denmark, Austria and Germany. Dr Lulek sang before the President of France and in recognition of his services to the Universite Populaire was in the same year decorated by the government and made an Officer de l'Academie Francaise. Dr Lulek came to America to fill a series of concert engagements in the summer of 1912 and was repeatedly heard in Newport, as also in Bar Harbor and Toronto, meeting with immediate emphatic success. In connection with his pedagogical activities he continued his concert work which in his first American tour 1913 included prominent solo and orchestral engagements and appearances at the Toronto Festival and in the New York Metropolitan Opera concert series. \n\nIn January 1912 Bertha Baur directress of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music met Dr Lulek in New York and succeeded in engaging him as head of her vocal department. In the meantime his concert engagements have continued with such organizations as the St Louis and Cincinnati Symphony orchestras with unvarying acclaim.\n\nHis remarkable success in developing voices is endorsed by many leading musicians, composers, directors and singers including such authorities as Victor Herbert, Dr Stillman Kelly,Henry Hadley, P.A. Tirindelli, Nahan Franko, John Cort, etc. Over fifty Lulek pupils have been placed as teachers in leading musical institutions throughout the country, others have operatic contracts, while still others are soloists in churches and upon the concert stage.\n\n The Lulek voice is a sympathetic smooth and exquisitely cultivated baritone of big power and he uses his organ with the most tactful and finished art New York audiences will have a chance to welcome this proved teacher and accomplished concert artist and to judge him anew when he reappears here at Aeolian Hall in his two recitals next October and March.&quot;\n\nHe had a recital at New York's Aeolian hall in November, 1919.\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A00E2D71031E03ABC4D51DFB7678382609EDE\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A00E2D71031E0...</a>\n\nIn July, 1922, he joined the Chicago Musical College\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=bmhFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=&quot;fery+lulek&quot;+chicago&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e81Ot63AoU&amp;sig=SygtD6eY66lJMCOrf-xLX8kPDMM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB3_OF4_LUAhUIrFQKHYQBCSkQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=&quot;fery lulek&quot; chicago&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=bmhFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lp...</a>","Fery Lulek (1876-1953)\n<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33126129\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33126129</a>","Thank you Art Siegel and Richard Norton for the fuller identification.

Miller (LOC)\" /></a>","Not a music typewriter,  &quot;This machine is the Blick Featherweight and is a development of the earlier Model 5 with an aluminium frame. Possibly the lightest portable typewriter ever produced, the Featherweight was marketed as the 'Five Pound Secretary'. &quot; It had a changeable typewheel, too.\n\nPhotos and a detailed description of how it worked at \n<a href=\"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/388118\" rel=\"nofollow\">collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/388118</a>","Nicely done [https://www.flickr.com/photos/artolog]!  &nbsp; It's just like you!  ;)\n\nI love the photograph by César Astudillo!  It's so interesting that there were these &quot;featherweight&quot; typewriters early on, and they seemingly just became bigger and heavier through the years.  And the similarity between the Blick's rotating type wheel (1910) and IBM Selectric's type balls 50 years later is amazing. (Blick offered 170 different type wheels according to the ad you found!)\n\nAs an aside, while searching earlier for music typewriters I noted that &quot;type writer&quot; appears to have begun as two words... and followed the usual sequence of becoming hyphenated and then one word -- albeit over a relatively short timeline.","That typewheel is pretty amazing.  I also like that there is no ribbon, and the typewheel inks itself on an ink roller, held up by that big metal arc piece, on the way down to the paper.\n\nThere are a lot of words like that, aren't there?  The hyphen from email seems to have finally disappeared.","Thanks for identifying the typist and the machine (in addition to the two word/one word issues, the person also used to be called a typewriter! <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter</a> ). We'll add information to the description at our end.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/barbara_loc], well I just spent 45+ minutes going down that Wikipedia rabbit hole -- including following a couple of &quot;tunnels&quot; that intersected said rabbit hole ;)  I now know more about typewriters than I could have ever imagined I would ;)  Who knew that the early 'failures' of electric typewriters gaining popularity was because different (US) cities used different voltages!\n\nAnd ... &lt;-- pun intended, discovered along said rabbit-hole-tunnel, I learned that the ampersand was once the 27th 'letter' of our alphabet (along with two other letters that were removed).<blockquote>&quot;In the early 1800s, school children reciting their ABCs concluded the alphabet with the &amp;. It would have been confusing to say “X, Y, Z, and.” Rather, the students said, “and per se and.” “Per se” means “by itself,” so the students were essentially saying, “X, Y, Z, and by itself and.” Over time, “and per se and” was slurred together into the word we use today: ampersand.&quot; <i>– <a href=\"http://blog.dictionary.com/ampersand/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog.dictionary.com/ampersand/</a></i></blockquote> So for those 45+ minutes I'll never get back, I thank you!  ;)","This could be (if in 1919 a very old photo of):\n&quot;Rogers, Alfred Thomas (b. 1873) — also known as Alfred T.
