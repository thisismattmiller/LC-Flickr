The demolition of these slums and the building of the park were crusades championed by Riis.\nHis account of the conditions and the building of the park (completed in 1897) is a bit long-winded, but still fascinating:\n&quot;The Bend is laid by the Heels&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/207/11.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bartleby.com/207/11.html</a>\n\nNo doubt  Mulberry Bend Park's history made it an ideal place to rally May Day marchers by the Anarchists of the day, like Berkman and Ganz.

Although, Marie Ganz was credited as having written Rebels in collaboration with Nat J Ferber, it should be noted that he was actually the biographer of her story.

He was acquitted with the first use of temporary insanity as a legal defense in U.S. history. He became one of the most prominent political generals of the Civil War.

Commissioned in April 1914, her first active service was off Vera Cruz, Mexico, during the U.S. intervention there. After more than three years of operations off the east coast and in the Caribbean, in December 1917 New York crossed the Atlantic to join the British Grand Fleet. She was flagship of the U.S. battleships of the Sixth Battle Squadron during the remainder of the First World War.\n\nIn mid-1919, New York transited the Panama Canal to the Pacific, where she was based during the next decade and a half. As a unit of the Battle Fleet, she took an active part in the exercises, drills and gunnery practices that were regularly held in the Pacific and Caribbean. New York underwent modernization in 1925-27, receiving new oil-fired boilers, anti-torpedo bulges on her hull sides, heavier deck armor, up-to-date gunfire control mechanisms and many other improvements that enhanced her combat capabilities. After being transferred to the Atlantic in the mid-1930s, she visited England in 1937 as the U.S. representative to the British Coronation naval review. Over the next three years, the battleship was actively employed as a training ship.\n\nWith the coming of war to Europe, New York participated in Neutrality Patrol operations, and, as the U.S. drew closer to the conflict in 1941, helped in the occupation of Iceland and in escorting convoys. Her convoy activities continued after the United States became a combatant in December 1941. In November 1942, New York also took part the North African invasion, providing gunfire support for landings at Safi, Morocco. She spent 1943 and most of 1944 on escort and training duties, steaming to the Pacific war zone in early 1945. In February, New York's big guns were active bombarding Iwo Jima before and during the Marines' assault on that island. She was similarly employed off Okinawa from late March until June, and was lightly damaged by a suicide plane on 14 April 1945.\n\nFollowing the Japanese capitulation in August 1945, New York moved back to the Atlantic and was at New York City for the Navy Day fleet review in late October. Her last active service was as a target during the atomic bomb tests at Bikini, Marshall Islands, in July 1946. Too radioactive and far too old for further use, she decommissioned a month later. In July 1948, USS New York was towed out to sea off Pearl Harbor and sunk as a target for Navy aircraft and ships.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-n/bb34.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-n/bb34.htm</a>","A great old picture and that was a darned interesting commentary Manfire.","Have a nice weekend.\n~Beautiful CaptUre ~Thanx 4 sharing","Awesome Pic!!!","Beautiful Capture!\n<a href=\"http://2.s03.flagcounter.com/more/wGN4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://2.s03.flagcounter.com/count/wGN4/bg=FFFFFF/txt=FFFFFF/border=FFFFFF/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=0/\" alt=\"Free counters!\" /></a><a href=\"http://2.s03.flagcounter.com/more/fp3V\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://2.s03.flagcounter.com/count/fp3V/bg=FFFFFF/txt=FFFFFF/border=FFFFFF/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=0/\" alt=\"Free counters!\" /></a>\n<a target=\"enlarge&amp;i=4jt1l09bjlo&amp;color=a00000&amp;m=1\" href=\"http://www.revolvermaps.com/?target=enlarge&amp;i=4jt1l09bjlo&amp;color=a00000&amp;m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://re.revolvermaps.com/h/b/26/4jt1l09bjlo.png\" width=\"26\" height=\"26\" alt=\"Map\" /></a>","I like this\n--\nSeen in my contacts' photos.

After a brief career in law, Buchan simultaneously began writing and his political and diplomatic career, serving as a private secretary to the colonial administrator of various colonies in Southern Africa, and eventually wrote propaganda for the British war effort in First World War. Once back in civilian life, Buchan was elected Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities, but spent most of his time on his writing career. He wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps and other adventure fiction. He was in 1935 appointed as governor general by George V, king of Canada, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada Richard Bennett, to replace the Earl of Bessborough as viceroy, and occupied that post until his death in 1940. Buchan proved to be enthusiastic about literacy, as well as the evolution of Canadian culture, and he received a state funeral in Canada before his ashes were returned to the UK and interred at Elsfield, Oxfordshire.\n\nSource: Wikipedia","perhaps on her first arrival to NY, 05-14-1914 maiden voyage from Cuxhaven to New York.

From 1897 (when she was 60) she was known as Mother Jones and in 1902 she was called &quot;the most dangerous woman in America&quot; for her success in organizing mine workers and their families against the mine owners.

The magazine Mother Jones , established in 1970, is named after her.

This act placed the two countries at the brink of war, creating a considerable amount of international tension.

Niagara Falls was selected as the location for the peace conference, with the meetings taking place at the Clifton House Hotel, now the  site of Oakes Garden Theatre.  The talks began on May 20. After about a month, an agreement was reached that averted a war between Mexico and the United States.  However, Mexico's internal strife continued.

Casasus to the arbitration panel charged with deciding the Chamizal dispute and is considered his finest legal effort. Because of his arguments, Mexico was awarded a substantial part of the disputed area, although the United States refused to recognize the arbitrators’ findings. The dispute arose because the Rio Grande river channel shifted significantly in 1864, placing in Texas about 600 acres of formerly Mexican territory as awarded in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (among the historical arguments cited is the Disturnell Treaty map). As generally understood, the Treaty allowed the border to shift with the Rio Grande, so long as the shift was gradual and caused by silting and other slow-acting factors. The arbitration panel was convened by both countries to decide the matter. Despite their ruling, the dispute was not totally solved until 1963, when President Kennedy agreed to the original arbitration findings.

Matches were rumored with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Britain's George V, and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Olga herself wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her home country. Olga's murder following the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later years, when dozens of people made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family, a woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but her claim was not taken seriously. Olga was assassinated along with her family at Ekaterinburg.

In 1899, he helped fund the rebuilding, and became manager, of His Majesty's Theatre. Again, he promoted a mix of Shakespeare and classic plays with new works and adaptations of popular novels, giving them spectacular productions in this large house, and often playing leading roles. His wife, actress Helen Maud Holt, often played opposite him and assisted him with management of the theatres.\nAlthough Tree was regarded as a versatile and skilled actor, particularly in character roles, by his later years, his technique was seen as mannered and old fashioned. He founded the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1904 and was knighted, for his contributions to theatre, in 1909. His famous family includes his siblings, explorer Julius Beerbohm, author Constance Beerbohm and caricaturist Max Beerbohm.

He recently underwent an operation in the ...\n\n=========\nGeorge Schlosser (1857-?) of Sioux Falls, Dakota\n\nGEORGE SCHLOSSER.\nIn newspaper circles the name of George Schlosser is widely known, for through an extended period he was connected with newspaper publication and news service. At the present time, however, he has retired from that field and is concentrating his efforts upon the management of his private business affairs and upon the furtherance of public activities and benevolent work, which make a strong appeal to him. He was born in Lodi, Wisconsin, September 3, 1857. His father, Henry Schlosser, a native of Germany, came to the United States in the early '50s. He was by trade a wagon maker and blacksmith and became identified with industrial interests at Lodi, where he conducted business until after the outbreak of the Civil war. He enlisted in the United States army during the latter part of that struggle and came to Dakota territory with General Sully, serving with the frontier forces for about fifteen months. He spent the later years of his life in Sioux Falls, passing away at the home of his son George in 1907, when he had reached the ripe old age of seventy-six years. His wife, who was Mrs. Frederica Schlosser. died during the early boyhood of their son George, who was the eldest of a family of six children.\nIn the public schools of Lodi. Wisconsin, George Schlosser was educated and later began learning the printer's trade in his home city. He was eager to master the business and continued in the house where he was originally employed, winning promotion from one position to another until 1883, when he came to Dakota territory. He settled first at Blunt, where he remained for five years, there establishing and conducting the Blunt Advocate. He afterward became a resident of Aberdeen, where he owned and published the Aberdeen Daily News. In 1896 he removed to Sioux Falls, where he established the ready print service, conducting business under the name of the South Dakota Newspaper Union. This undertaking, carefully managed by Mr. Schlosser, became a distinct success and advanced him far on the high road to fortune. In 1911 he disposed of the business and since that time has devoted his energies to his private business affairs and investments and to the many public undertakings in which he is deeply interested and which have constituted a vital force in pushing forward the wheels of progress in this section of the state. He served for some time as the efficient and popular secretary of the Commercial Club, his efforts in that direction being highly resultant and beneficial. He resigned in July, 1914. to take up the promotion of the Sioux Falls &amp; Western Railway, which project is destined to make tributary to Sioux Falls an important section of the state with large natural resources needing a market outlet. He was the promoter of the Carpenter Hotel and has been largely instrumental in bringing various business enterprises and valuable commercial projects to the city. He is one of the directors and stockholders of the Queen City Fire Insurance Company and his private investments have been of an important and gratifying character.\nMr. Schlosser is free from partisan bias in his efforts for the public good and thus casts an independent local ballot, but where national issues are involved votes with the republican party. He was postmaster of the city and is president of the Sioux Falls public library and along lines which tend to ameliorate the hard conditions of life for the unfortunate he has done important and helpful work. He is president of the South Dakota Children's Home Society and has been deeply interested in this most worthy charity since its foundation","he had a long and eventful life, mixing with the rich and powerful, eventually becoming Viceroy (Governor General)  of Canada\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge,_1st_Earl_of_Athlone\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cambridge,_1st_Earl_of_At...</a>","His wife was\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4545362697/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4545362697_6ccab6fbee_m.jpg\" width=\"173\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Princess Alexander of Teck (LOC)\" /></a>\nand another picture of him\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5208803161/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5208803161_ea94966182_m.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Prince Alexander of Teck (LOC)\" /></a>","German-English royalty.","John Purroy Mitchel, Mayor of New York City.

La colonia española en Torreón era numerosísima y muchos buscaron refugio en los hoteles, pero la gran mayoría lo hizo en el sótano del Banco de la Laguna (esquina de avenida Juárez y calle Cepeda, frente a la Plaza de Armas), a donde entró Villa y les dirigió un discurso a manera de regaño. Les menciona que para que no se digera que era un asesino no los fusilaría como se merecían y que les daba 48 horas para que abandonaran el país.\nPero la fecha 4 de abril deja muchas dudas.  ¿Donde estaba el ejército federal ese día?

On 18 October 1863 he found himself in Charleston, West Virginia, when the town was surrounded and attacked by Confederate General John Daniel Imboden, 62nd Virginia Mounted Infantry. He was captured and held prisoner at Andersonville.\n\nIt was during this time, June, 1863 - November, 1864 (17 months), his wife evidently became pregnant, but he could not possibly be the father. She sought out one, Doctor S.D. Kell, seeking to obtain an abortion 'during an advanced stage'. Dr. Kell gave her a lethal dose of a poison designed to cause an abortion and evidently lied to authorities to cover his mistake. Dr. Kell was charged with murder. He posted a $5,000.00 bond and was released pending trial.\n\nIn December, 1864, my ancestor was paroled. He returned to Baltimore, Maryland, and was mustered out of the Army. But his Civil War service wasn't over. In March, 1865 he enlisted in the 91st Pennsylvania Infantry, Company C. This unit was present at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, April, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses Grant. He was mustered out of the Army in July 1865.\n\nTrue story.","Only a second lieutenant at his age? The Confederates had generals who were younger! Like Mary Todd Lincoln's brothers!

I never knew where they found the images, but there were three pictures in a lot which included a ninth plate of a Confederate Ordnance Sergeant, a Confederate Captain, and a South Carolina Militia Officer.  All three pics came right out of the woodwork, and were not images compiled in a group, but rather a set that were found together after sitting in an estate for 100+ years.  The Sgt. had an ID in period ink on the cushion of the photograph that said &quot;Father of R I Barnes.&quot;...when I got the photographs, I noticed that the backside of the picture said &quot;William Sharpe Barnes, 19 years old&quot;...I researched the name but didn't find anything solid.  Just last week, I did a general search of William Sharpe Barnes on Google, and there was a hit on <a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com</a>.  I saw that the soldier was born in 1843, so this was a possibility.  I looked at the site and saw that the Sgt. rose in rank to Lt., and then to Aide-de-Camp for General Bryan Grimes of the 4th North Carolina...WOW!!!....On the find a grave site, the information stated that William had 4 children.  The last child on the list was Ralph Ivor Barnes (R I Barnes)...YES!!!!...There was the hit I was looking for...It solidified the ID of the soldier to the bone.  The other thing I noticed on the site was that William had a brother, Jesse Sharpe Barnes, who graduated from the Univ. of North Carolina and enlisted as a Captain in the 4th N.C. Infantry.  There is my other ninth plate ambrotype.  An ambro of a Captain, and it is the same guy as the soldier on Flickr above.  There is no doubt in my mind that my ambrotype of the Captain is William's brother.  He enlisted as a Captain and was killed at Seven Pines, Virginia in 1862.  I am attaching a link to the find a grave site to show what I found.  <a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=46267013&amp;rand=333\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=462670...</a>              I believe with 99% confidence that the soldier on flickr is Jesse Sharpe Barnes of the 4th N.C. Infantry.  Other than the mustache and hat, it is the same guy...no doubt about it.

The 1st and 3rd division colors, for all Corps badges, were red and blue, respectively, and would be seen as much darker in these old black and white photos.  \nThe 2nd Division of the 2nd Corps is noteworthy for being at the stone wall during Pickett's Charge.","It wasnt Hooker who developed/designed the actual badges. He might have instituted them officially though.\n\nThis is what is said bout corps badges on General Philip Kearnys wiki-site.\n\nKearny is credited with devising the first unit insignia patches used in the U.S. Army. In the summer of 1862, he issued an order that his officers should wear a patch of red cloth on the front of their caps to identify themselves as members of his unit. The enlisted men, with whom Kearny was quite popular, quickly followed suit of their own volition. Members of other units picked up on the idea, devising their own insignia, and these evolved over the years into the modern shoulder patch. (Daniel Butterfield is credited with taking Kearny's idea and standardizing it for all corps in the Army of the Potomac, designing most of the corps badges.) Kearny was promoted to major general on July 4, 1862.","Fred Hall and shipraider06:\n\nThanks for your comments and further identification!

These plates were purchased at some point between the adoption of a state button in 1855 and the outbreak of war in 1861.  The Army had switched to large waist belt plates by 1857 but a number of states adhered to the old pattern through 1862.  A considerable quantity of this style was acquired as many have been recovered from the battlefields and camps of Virginia.&quot;*\n\n&quot;The Volunteer Militia of Maine (VMM), as it was formally named, was organized in 1851 and restructured in 1861 to raise and equip ten regiments of volunteer infantry for two years of Federal service.

There were about 400 of them, disguised as men.","I wonder if he lived to see the end of the Civil War?","This fellow's buckle is upside down -- this must have been taken early in basic training.  :)","No. Again, I believe this is a Confederate. If CSA or state buckles were scarce they would reverse acquired Union ones,  a common practice.","Addendum: The high collar was much more common in Southern enlisted men's uniforms. Also, the rather ancient looking smoothbore musket. Even early on, Union soldiers had better rifles, by and large, though recently cartridge boxes found at Antietam (Sharpsburg) showed some Union Infantry units were still carrying smoothbores in late 1862","That sounds reasonable.  I also note now that the &quot;U&quot; was painted in upside down, so whatever the reason it wasn't accidental.","Upside down US buckle is a clue this fellow may have been a regular US infantryman until his state seceded. Or it is a captured or liberated belt. The jaunty brim angle of his kepi say &quot;Johnny Reb&quot; to me. Men fighting on the southern side were predominantly volunteers and tended to express such positive fighting spirit throughout the war.","He is most likely a federal soldier. It's not an upside down belt buckle, it's an upside down belt. The whole thing is upside down because he flipped it to wear on the opposite side of his body. The cap box is also upside down. He knew that the photo would inverse everything and they sometimes compensated for that. Doing it like this made the bayonet scabbard on the (to the viewer) &quot;correct&quot; side of the body.","Now that seems to make the most sense -- I didn't notice the cap box.  I note he's holding his rifle with a left-handed grip, probably for the same reason, and there are a dozen or so pictures in this collection with the upside-down belt like this one.  \n\nOnly now I wonder why, if the photographer was going to retouch the buckle anyway, he didn't paint it correctly.","The image is a mirror image, and the buckle is upside down for a reason; he is a Confederate soldier. The captured buckles from Federal depots were turned upside down and used as needed.","Also, the upside-down buckle resembled a &quot;N.S.&quot; which stood for &quot;New South&quot;","Good photo\nBoa foto\nصور جيدة\nHình ảnh tốt\nGutes Foto\nΚαλή φωτογραφιών\nBella foto\nХорошие фото","This guy's cocky smirk and raised eyebrow make this probably my favorite Civil War portrait.","It's actually extremely common for Union soldiers to turn their equipment upside down for the photographs so that their equipment would be on the correct side, due to the mirror image. A dead give away is the fact that the cap pouch is upside down. He's a Federal soldier. Sorry folks.","nahh--he's confederate.  I've seen the same uniform sleeves on other Rebs....  besides, if he was militia prior to secession, his buckle would look like that.  They wore what they had.","For some reason this print is reversed -- the &quot;US&quot; on his buckle is backward, and the hammer's on the left side of his rifle.

He seems to be holding the revolver across his chest, not an uncommon pose at the time.  If he were actually joking and holding it at the man seated, it seems it would be a little lower and tilted.  And... what might the gentleman standing on the right be looking at?  The other four all appear to be looking straight into the camera... except for the other man standing.  Some noise or a movement caught his attention at just that moment?  Perhaps mom or sweetheart talking to him?  Fanciful thoughts...","Agreed. It's a pose, not a joke. It's pointed at his own arm, and he's behind the seated man far enough to accommodate the chair he's sitting in and the crook of his arm as he's resting it on the man's shoulder.","What about the two holding hands? Seems rather strange, unless they were related.","Were these guys serious or not?  They aren't &quot;clowning around.&quot; If it was meant to be humorous, it was a very dry humor, and one of them wasn't on board with that at all (to the far left). And would they waste a studio photograph by being silly? Maybe. Had they been drinking? Did the photographer suggest some silly posing? The hand-holding man seated is also holding his head in a way that enhances the feeling of intimacy between them. The man standing is definitely not.\n\nI've seen other photographs of Civil War soldiers who were engaged in displays of affection, some more overt than this.  This is one of those instances where we need to be careful not to revise history based on our own frames of reference, but - joking or not, I think these poses implied then what they would imply  today. There was certainly physical and/or emotional intimacy (sexual/romantic) among male soldiers at that time, but it seems highly unlikely they would immortalize this in a photo that would, presumably, be seen by friends and family. I don't think male relatives that had a close relationship would pose like this.  It would be really interesting to be able to go back and ask them! \n\nThe standing man not looking at the camera - that isn't a daydreaming gaze, in my opinion, it's a blank stare. The photographer would have told them not to move. I've seen a lot of early photos where people have a stiff look like this. And - he's holding another man's hand. Joking or not, he's probably not daydreaming about his mom or sweetheart.","Wild guess:  One non-romantic reason that the men might be holding hands (or touching hands) so freely and visibly would be if the man in back were blind.  He might well have a hand on his friend's shoulder, just as it appears here, and the friend might simply be touching or holding his hand as a signal or reassurance.  That might also account for his gaze being off from the direction his friends are looking.","I believe the men &quot;holding hands&quot; were doing so due to a strong sense of camaraderie - or, at least - to create that impression. Camaraderie between troops (on both sides) was very strong, and, back then, they were not opposed to the physical expression of such. Homosexuality was taboo, particularly amongst the military, so any &quot;romantic&quot; expression is extremely unlikely, especially since they are being photographed with compatriots. &quot;Holding hands&quot;, in any public arena, would have more than likely resulted in the participants being, at a minimum,  tarred and feathered.","I'm guessing that they are related or compatriots. Back then, displays of affection were not seen in the same way as they are today. Also, I agree that the gun holder is simply displying the gun by holding it across his chest for the photograph.","he's not clowning with that gun -- he's showing it off. it's obviously his pride!","Am I the only that noticed that the uniform of the seated man is lighter in color? Maybe he's a confederate prisoner?","I've seen an unframed version of this photo. The man at the bottom left has his hand upon the thigh of the man in the center. Without that I would have thought pennlrichardsca's suggestion might be true, that the man on the upper left who is looking off camera might be blind.","In certain parts of the world, men walk around holding hands and holding hands with women, even your wife/girlfriend is taboo. I know how people love to read modern thoughts into such things.","perhaps they're kin.  Wish we knew their names.","Perhaps, just perhaps, this was one of those post-mortem posed photos which were not uncommon in the 1800's and wherein the eyes were often painted black dots on closed eyelids.  The two in the back could be keeping his head propped up with their elbows, and the fabric pulling on the potentially deceased shoulder could be because of the propping arm.  The hand he has partially raised could be held up by the right-back man, as the seated (potentially deseased) man seems to have no real grasp look to his hand.  The man seated to the right is sitting up straight with shoulders back, but the middle fellow isn't sitting up with intentional pose, although the guy on the left is also slouching, he could also be deceased with his head also being propped by the other elbow.  Just a possibility, as this photo is odd by today's standards in a few ways.   And I agree that the guy is holding his gun up, but not at the seated man's head.","Same backdrop?\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5229160930/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5288/5229160930_48fc6e45f2_m.jpg\" width=\"195\" height=\"240\" alt=\"[Unidentified sailor in Union uniform resting hand on American flag-draped table in front of painted backdrop showing naval scene] (LOC)\" /></a>","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52449979227/in/photolist-2nUPRuF\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52449979227/in/photolist-...</a>","amazing...","Poignant and wonderful image","he might have been with them 1st Connecticut Cavalry or the 29th virginia infantry.\n\nI did a search on Ancestry dot com and here is what i came up with\n\n<a href=\"http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=MIL_PHOTOS&amp;rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;MSAV=0&amp;msT=1&amp;gss=angs-c&amp;gsfn=Carl&amp;msbdy=1847&amp;msydy=1865&amp;msypn__ftp=Virginia%2c+USA&amp;msypn=49&amp;msypn_PInfo=5-\" rel=\"nofollow\">search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=MIL_PHOTOS&amp;ran...</a>|1652393|2|3245|49|&amp;uidh=000&amp;so=2\n\nname might be Carl Von Grafeurice was at Fort Lyon, VA","heartbreaking.","<a href=\"http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/five-forks/two-days-in-april-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.civilwar.org/battlefields/five-forks/two-days-in-apri...</a>","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52449825867/in/photolist-2nUP4Ux\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52449825867/in/photolist-...</a>","Same backdrop as \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9158134705\" title=\"[Unidentified soldier in Union uniform with sword in front of painted backdrop showing weapons and American flag at Benton Barracks, Saint Louis, Missouri]  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3672/9158134705_21f5daff34_n.jpg\" width=\"272\" height=\"320\" alt=\"[Unidentified soldier in Union uniform with sword in front of painted backdrop showing weapons and American flag at Benton Barracks, Saint Louis, Missouri]  (LOC)\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9158133641\" title=\"[Unidentified soldier of \"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2886/9158133641_28650a8362_n.jpg\" width=\"256\" height=\"320\" alt=\"[Unidentified soldier of \" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9158134147\" title=\"[Unidentified soldier of 33rd Missouri Infantry Regiment with bayoneted musket and revolver in front of painted backdrop showing weapons and American flag at Benton Barracks, Saint Louis, Missouri]  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/9158134147_59995dc006_n.jpg\" width=\"285\" height=\"320\" alt=\"[Unidentified soldier of 33rd Missouri Infantry Regiment with bayoneted musket and revolver in front of painted backdrop showing weapons and American flag at Benton Barracks, Saint Louis, Missouri]  (LOC)\" /></a>","<a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52449817352/in/photolist-2nUP2nJ\">flickr.com/photos/193005003@N06/52449817352/in/photolist-...</a>","That is strangely adorable.","Bizarrely romantic","Beautiful image.","This is hilarious!","This will be featured someday in an unwritten book called <b><i>The Cigars They Smoked: The History of &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;</i></b>","this is such a funny shot (0=","Both of them must be very sad if* they know that they are part of the unknown histories.","nice <img src=\"http://2.s07.flagcounter.com/count/DymW/bg=FFFFFF/txt=FFFFFF/border=FCFCFC/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=0/\" alt=\"Free counters!\" />\n<img src=\"http://s07.flagcounter.com/count/DymW/bg=FFFFFF/txt=FFFFFF/border=FCFCFC/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=0/\" alt=\"Free counters!\" />","That is hilarious.","It is not romantic or DADT when you see camaraderie.

Se unió al pronunciamiento del Plan de Agua Prieta contra el Presidente Venustiano Carranza; después fue leal al gobierno del General Álvaro Obregón, alcanzando el grado de General Brigadier. Triunfó en la lucha electoral para ser Gobernador de Durango en el periodo de 1928 a 1932, tomando posesión del cargo el 15 de septiembre de 1928; sin embargo, en marzo del año siguiente se adhirió al Plan de Hermosillo, obrando de acuerdo con el Jefe de las Operaciones en el estado, el General Francisco Urbalejo, para secundar al General José Gonzalo Escobar, que se había pronunciado en Torreón. Abandonó el gobierno al fracasar este movimiento además de que el gobierno federal le desconoció su grado militar, refugiándose en los Estados Unidos, donde permaneció varios años.

His start that year was lackluster, so he was banished to the Philadelphia team, where he didn't do much better. Early in 1914, he grabbed a chance to return to Pittsburgh by joining a new team, the Pittsburgh Rebels -- one of eight teams in the newly-formed Federal League (whose existence was brief). The report of his leap to the Federals likely was the news event that impelled the Bain News Agency to circulate this photo of Camnitz to its subscribers. Camnitz continued with the Rebels in 1915, but retired from baseball in that year, because of problems with his pitching arm.","You wouldn't want that chain to break at any kind of speed.

Not wishing to be on the same team as the swaggering Oldfield he quit on the spot. Oldfield was well pleased until he found out that DePalma had announced that he would MODIFY HIS OLD MERCEDES and enter as a private individual. [Emphasis added.]\n\n&quot;Playing a waiting game he watched as the leading cars including Oldfield wore out their tires. Ten laps from the end he saw his chance and sprinted into the lead. In front of him was Oldfield but as soon as he passed his rival he made signals to his pit that he was coming in. Seeing this Oldfield decided to make a pitstop also to replace worn tires. As Oldfield’s Mercer was having his tires replaced he glanced onto the track just as DePalma was driving by. It dawned on Oldfield in a second, he had been tricked, DePalma never planned to stop. In a rage the Mercer leapt out of the pits. Oldfield, for all his braggadocio was not without talent or courage. For the last 6 laps he gave everything that he had to close the gap but fell 200 yards short as DePalma took the flag.&quot;","The photo shows DePalma at the time of winning of the 200-mile 1914 Vanderbilt Cup race, which followed an eight-mile course over the public roads of Santa Monica, California.

En 1912 tomó las armas ante la sublevación de Pascual Orozco. Formaba parte de las fuerzas irregulares comandadas por Francisco Villa, con el puesto de artillero. Combatió a Emilio P. Campa en Parral, Chihuahua. En 1913, como consecuencia de la usurpación de Victoriano Huerta, retornó a las armas y a la artillería de la División del Norte. Participó en 1913 en los ataques de Torreón, Chihuahua, Tierra Blanca y Ojinaga, bajo las órdenes directas Pánfilo Natera García. En 1914 destacó su actuación militar en las acciones de Torreón, San Pedro de las Colonias y Paredón. Apoyó a Francisco Villa en su decisión de atacar Zacatecas y sobresalió en el bombardeo de cerro de Loreto. Participó en la Convención de Aguascalientes. Ante la escisión revolucionaria continuó en las filas villistas, quedando bajo las órdenes de Felipe Ángeles y operando con el grado de coronel, más tarde lograría el grado de general brigadier. Murió en combate, el 5 de enero de 1915, en una batalla cerca de Ciudad Ramos Arizpe bajo las órdenes del general Felipe Ángeles en contra de las fuerzas de Venustiano Carranza comandadas por el famoso general Maclovio Herrera, las cuales perdieron la batalla de ese día.

The USS Memphis (ex-Tennessee) (ACR-10/CA-10) was a very different ship than the one photographed above.  USS Memphis (ex-Tennessee) (ACR-10/CA-10) featured a tumblehome/ram bow and casement gun positions along her hull, and, while approximately 50' shorter in length than an Omaha-class cruiser, was almost 20' greater in beam and twice the displacement .  Also, an identifying feature of the Omaha-class cruisers (such as USS Memphis (CL-13)) was the relatively unique placement of casement guns in the superstructure (four each fore and aft), as depicted above.  \n\nOf course, radical changes to a ship's appearance may come about after various refits and upgrades, but that was not the case with USS Memphis (ex-Tennessee) (ACR-10/CA-10).  Here's a link to a photo of USS Memphis (CA-10) as she meets her demise in Santo Domingo harbor:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Tennessee_ACR-10_-_photo_NH59921.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Tennessee_ACR-10_-_photo_N...</a>\n\nI would still maintain that the ship photographed above is the later USS Memphis (CL-13), and if not, one of her Omaha-class sister-ships.","Yes, the photos definitely show two different ships. And I confess that I know virtually nothing about Navy ships -- or any ships, really. So the explanation we are left with is that the Bain negative of the Memphis has been filed more than ten years out of order -- something that happens infrequently, but does happen, perforce.","Wystan: The filing is all Bain's doing!  The Library obediently follows the photo agency's original order, indicated by the identification number scratched into the glass plate -- in this case 3019-3.  Significant date anomalies have appeared before, though.  It's speculation still, but we're wondering if the Bain agency sometimes replaced an old view of a subject with a newer view and kept the same number.

About your comment on why we don't correct  the exposure of this image--at least three concerns hold us back from editing images. \n\nAuthenticity: Digitizing a photograph as it has survived through time reassures viewers that we're representing the original artifact faithfully. Editing an image undermines the reliability of the photo as a historical document. Once we start changing the tonal contrast of the image, who's to know how much other image content we changed.\n \nSubjective choices: Different users have different preferences when it comes to pumping up contrast, sharpening edges, cropping negative borders, etc.  Offering the basic image allows users make their own decisions about which features to change to suit a particular purpose or product.\n\nLack of money and time: If we had more resources, offering a 'cleaned up photo' in addition to the 'raw document' could be considered.  (Like pre-conservation and post-conservation images of a damaged and then repaired poster.) But our priority is basic digital access -- many more of the Library’s 14 million pictures should be available online first.","Victuallers2 and Wystan:  Abraham Gonzalez seems to be known primarily as the Governor of the Mexican state of Chihuahua and a leader of the Mexican Revolution. However, some contemporary sources, such as an article in the St. Louis Dispatch of May 17, 1914 identify him as a general.  Possibly it was an honorific title.  Does any one else have information about this question?  In any case, we would leave &quot;Gen.&quot; in the title, as it reflects the information provided by Bain on the negative.  We can add additional information about him to the image description.","There's a similar version of this picture in Wheelan collection of the Mexican Revolution.

As John Cascales, he featured as jazz tenor man on west coast radio programs in the mid '30s. A brother, Carlos Cascales aka Chuck Cabot, led his own orchestra starting in 1940. \n\nRichards joined Stan Kenton's arranging staff in 1950 and relocated to New York City by 1952, continuing to work for Kenton's band until he died of a brain tumor in 1968. He was also composer of the hit tune &quot;Young at Heart&quot; (1953).","Great genius. Wrote one of Kenton's greatest albums, Cuban Fire.

It is noteworthy because during this period the NYPD became one of the few police departments of the era to have adopted a semi-automatic pistol as an issued firearm (in this case for its detectives.)  However, the M1908's career in the NYPD was short lived, and it was withdrawn from NYPD service by 1918 (thought to be because of accidental/negligent discharges by some of the officers it was issued to).

This law was later held to be invalid under the 1882 statutes. Thus another law was passed in 1918 modifying the statutes to allow the adoption of an heir, with succession rights.

An article in McClure's Magazine (May 1924), p. 57, includes a front-facing portrait of her from later in her life, and the features seem to match.  Other biographical details I gathered along the way from this article and one in Town &amp; Country (Feb. 8, 1913): She was the daughter of New Orleans banker Michael Heine.  She married Armand de Jumilhac at age 16 and became the duchesse de Richelieu two years later when he inherited the title.  She was a widow with two children by age 24, and she married Prince Albert of Monaco in 1889.  They divorced in 1902, and because of a prenuptial agreement she sacrificed a large part of her fortune to her husband when they parted ways.\n\nWe'll add some information to the description when we next update to identify her and indicate that the portrait was likely from an earlier photograph.","Mrs Frank Laying Schoonmaker sued her husband for divorce around this time.

At twenty-two he took his savings to Buffalo and in 1873 came out with his own paper, the Buffalo Sunday News, which was a success.\n\nOn October 11, 1880, his weekday paper, the Buffalo Evening News, came out and sold more than 7,000 copies on the street alone. It cost only a cent, whereas most contemporary dailies cost two or three cents. Circulation boomed to 20,000, and soon the News enjoyed the largest circulation of any paper between New York and Chicago.\n\n[In 1896, a new building was built for the newspaper operations at 218 Main St.]\n\nButler was given to leading crusades, including discipline at the Elmira Reformatory, enlargement of the Erie Canal, and a new building for the State Normal School in Buffalo.\n\nHe was an original member of the Grade Crossing Commission and continued on it for twenty-six years. He never ran for public office but was a dominant figure in the state G.O.P.\n\nHis wife was Mary E. Barber of Pittston, Pennsylvania, who died in 1893. Two children survived their father, one of whom, Edward H. Butler, Jr., succeeded when Edward, I, died in 1914. &quot;","I started an entry in Wikipedia on the father:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hubert_Butler,_Sr\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hubert_Butler,_Sr</a>.","swanq:\n\nI would agree this seems more likely to be the elder Edward H.

He was motivated to search for a non-breakable, and clear substance on which he could place the images he utilized in his Biblical teachings.

They said he was not very nice to people.  Sorry, but that is what many have told me.  However, he put together some great bands.  That recording of the 1938 Carnegie Hall concert is still one of the greatest Big Band albums ever made.","I've heard the very same from others who have worked with him.\n\nTo say he was a perfectionist is merely another way of saying he was a true artist. I'm an artist,  and I'm rather particular about my work. I wont be satisfied till it meets my standards… We have our minds made up as to how we want things, how things are to look and to sound. Goodman was indeed this type. As to him not being kind may have mostly been a frustration with whipping musicians into shape, other musicians are artists too so, there's where other styles and ideas collide. Benny was the leader of the band so, I can see where he could get grumpy with others. \n\nI've heard accounts from first daughter that he'd get frustrated when helping her with her own musical endeavors. His patience wore thin from time to time, and he'd insist she practice the piano to perfect her skill… but, at the end she knew he loved her and only wanted her to succeed.","I am a perfectionist also in certain things.  I am a perfectionist when ti comes to photography.  I am a perfectionist in my writings.  I am a perfectionist in making prints.  But, I do think a person can be a &quot;true artist&quot; and not be a perfectionist.  Perfectionism often stifles art and life in general.  An artist, for example, could spend a lifetime on one piece of art.  Is that good?  Maybe, maybe not.  Some things that are &quot;perfect&quot; are not my idea my idea of art.  \n\nOne thing I liked about Goodman was that he would not put up with guys doing drugs.  Although drugs may have stirred creativity in musicians, they also spelled the ends of many careers.  If I were a band leader, I wouldn't want drug users in my band, either.  If you want to do drugs, fine, that's up to you....but you won't be in my band.  Or on my baseball team.  Or my business or personal partner.\n\nLong live Benny Goodman's music.","Love this pic!","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babs_Gonzales\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babs_Gonzales</a>","Spanish-born American guitarist, classical and flamenco.\n<a href=\"http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Gomez-Vicente.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Gomez-Vicente.htm</a>","This is absolutely fabulous.\n<b>Please, add your beautiful image to:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/peace_and_heart/\"><img src=\"http://i53.tinypic.com/be7fac.jpg\" title=\"PEACE AND HEART\" /> \n&quot;✽❀✽♥PEACE AND HEART✽❀✽♥ \n✽❀✽♥(Post 1 Award 3)✽❀✽♥&quot;</a></b>","Excellent","This does not look like the same women as some others of Adele Girard, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4977085064/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4977085064/</a>.

He received the second-highest vote total, behind Ty Cobb and tied with Babe Ruth.\nAlthough Cobb is frequently cited as the greatest player of the dead-ball era, some contemporaries regarded Wagner as the better all-around player, and most baseball historians consider Wagner to be the greatest shortstop ever. Cobb himself called Wagner &quot;maybe the greatest star ever to take the diamond.&quot;","These are my personal thoughts, not simply stuff copied and pasted from the Internet:\nWagner was the greatest shortstop of his era, but defensively he would never stack up against Luis Aparicio, Ozzie Smith, and any of about 20 shortstops since Ozzie.  Shortstops in the old days never had the range and arms of today's stars.  I would say Leo Durocher, PeeWee Reese, Phil Rizzuto, Chico Carasquel, Don Kessinger, and even Ernie Banks were all better defensively than Wagner, too.  But, you have to compare players against their peers, and there was no one as good as Wagner in his era.  \n\n It is true that one of the reasons dead ball era shortstops did not have the range they have today is that their gloves were pretty much useless unless the player could get his bare hand to cover the ball, in other words use both hands, to catch it.  It was hard to reach out and catch a ball with a glove that had no web or lacing between the fingers and was built flat versus the more modern gloves which are curved and have nice webs.  Also, infields of artificial turf don't create bad hops except very occasionally when the ball hits a seem or edge.  The ball moves faster, so it is easier for it to get through a hole.  However, it also gets to the fielder quicker so that he can make the throw in time to usually get the runner.  \n\nWe don't see the number of infield hits that occurred during the high grass and dead ball era.  This is one of the reasons batting averages were higher among good hitters in the old days. Guys like Wagner got a substanital number of bunt hits because of the high grass.  The dead ball era obviously came to an end with Babe Ruth.  Coincidence or just his sheer power?  Well, remember,Ruth was the only one for a few years who hit a ton of homeruns, so it was his sheer power.  But, gradually, balls were wound tighter and went farther.  Also, Ruth never choked up on his bat which gave him more power.  Wagner always choked up on the bat and that helped him accumulate 3,435 lifetime hits in 21 years.  Ruth had 2,873 hits in 22 years.  Both Wagner and Ruth were in that elete first class of 8 in the Hall of Fame in 1936.  We read and hear of Babe Ruth all the time, but, frankly Honus Wagner today is most remembered for having his picture on the most valuable baseball card of all time.","<b>Honus Wagner</b> (Johannes Peter Wagner: 1874–1955) was honored with this 33&cent; US commemorative stamp in 2000 as part of the <i>Classic Collections: Legends of Baseball</i> issue. The Legends of Baseball issue honored 20 baseball greats who were named to the &quot;All-Century Team,&quot; announced after the 1999 season. Votes from fans, as well as members of a special panel, selected the team.<blockquote>&quot;These players embody the glory and tradition of our national past-time. Tales of their extraordinary abilities and larger-than-life personalities have made them much more than just ballplayers: THEY ARE LEGENDS.\n\n“The Pittsburgh Pirates’ star shortstop, Honus Wagner also was a league-leading batter and base stealer. The ‘Flying Dutchman’ enjoyed 15 consecutive .300 seasons, 8 as the National League batting champ.” <i>&ndash; From the back of the sheet of stamps.</i></blockquote>\n\nAfter his retirement from baseball, Wagner coached several teams, including the Pirates from 1933 to 1951. He also owned a sporting goods store with fellow player Pie Traynor. In 1936, Honus Wagner was one of the first five players elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\nFirst Day of Issue ceremonies were held July 6, 2000, in Atlanta, Georgia, where Major League Baseball held the 2000 All Star Week and 2000 All Star Game.

The bulk of this book concentrates on the diplomatic years of Vance McCormick, as he served during the times leading to our entry in World War I through the war years and he was at a participant at the peace talks. \n\nIt is interesting reading how the editor and Penn State Harrisburg students went through nine boxes of family letters and documents to compile this book. Students of local history may wish to note that Vance McCormick was a director of the Central Iron and Steel Works which used to be located in the southern part of Harrisburg, that he was elected to City Council and then, in 1902, as Mayor as a reform Democrat, and then went on to own the Harrisburg Patriot newspaper and found the Evening News, which lasted until a few years ago. \n\nAmerican History scholars will find the bulk of this book as an insight into one diplomat's perspective of our effort to conduct a blockade of German ships during the First World War and of various missions before and after the war. Football fans may find it interesting to note that Vance McCormick was an All American quarterback on an 1892 Yale team that outscored its opponents by 435 to 0, but that McCormick scored none of those points. In football then, players played both offense and defense, and McCormick was noted for his defensive skills and his leadership at quarterback during a time when quarterbacks seldom scored goals. \n\nThe set of Vance McCormick diary entries during 1917, when he led the War Trade Board, fail to provide the perspectives that later diary entries provide. He would write comments such as &quot;we made some progress, but not as much as I had hoped&quot; without describing the circumstances of the discussions that would have proven more enlightening to future generations of readers. Still, his notations that he was impressed with the commitment the British had for the war allows us to realize that the American government was impressed that America could eventually successfully serve as a British ally. \n\nLater diary entries, after the United States entered the war, are more vibrant. His descriptions of the miles of destruction around Verdun, site of the war's most devastating battlefield, are among highlights found in these diaries. We learn about his concern during the peace talks about the sinking condition of the German people and his concern about the imperialism and militarism expressed by the war victors. Vance McCormick thought it was ridiculous of Lloyd George of England to promise the British people he would extract $120 billion in war reparations from Germany as Germany had no ability to pay anywhere close to that amount. This becomes of historic interest as he may have perceived the dangers that many historians believe ultimately led to the German resentment that led to World War II. Further, Vance McCormick expressed concern over blockades of Poland, Estonia, Lettland, and Lithuania, which the British supported, fearing that the blockade would allow these countries to fall to Russia. Of special note is his concern that the Germans might not accept the peace agreement as there were fears the French and English armies could no longer continue to battle the German army and that, should the peace talks collapse, it would be left for the American army to fight the German army. \n\nThe book notes that Vance McCormick placed his opinions above political party loyalty. He refused, as a supporter of prohibition, to support anti-prohibition Democratic nominees for President in 1928 and for Governor in 1930. Dauphin County Democrats then ousted a party slate run by McCormick. \n\nReading diary entries of a diplomat may be boring to many, but they serve an important historical purpose. Reviving insights into these historical moments maintains our awareness and connections to our past. It has been reported that, in 2004, the last known surviving combat wounded American veteran of World War I passed away. There are historians who observe that we could have learned from World War I the mistakes that led to World War II. Let us not let this history dissolve.

In April 1897, he was appointed code commissioner and served until July 31, 1899. He was member of the State Senate from 1907 to 1913 and served as United States commissioner general of immigration from 1913 to 1921. As immigration chief he displayed a naked Eurocentic xenophobia and argued that the U.S. Congress should end all immigration of Chinese, Japanese and Malays because they represented the &quot;Asiatic menace.&quot; In 1917, he was appointed a member of the War Industries Board and after the war was sent to Europe to investigate conditions there. He engaged in the practice of law in Jackson until his death in 1923. He was buried in the Protestant Cemetery.","hi phillippines","Thanks for the information, Richard Arthur Norton.

Cheap Chinese labor built the western end of the Union Pacific Railroad, but California's native workingmen resented Asians' competition for jobs. As a result of agitation by California politicos, President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 appointed James B. Angell, president of the University of Michigan here in Ann Arbor, as Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China, to negotiate a treaty which curtailed, but did not entirely prohibit, what had been viewed as a &quot;flood&quot; of cheap Chinese labor. Angell managed the delicate task, but after he returned to the U. S. in 1881, Congress negated his efforts by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which slammed the door shut. \n\nWhile Angell and his wife were in China, they were charmed by the educated Chinese that they met, and invited them to enroll their children at the University of Michigan. A University regent, Levi L. Barbour, established a scholarship program here for Chinese women.","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._West\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._West</a>\n\nWilliam Stanley West (August 23, 1849 – December 22, 1914) was a United States Senator from the state of Georgia.

In addition to painting in Ogunquit, a small fishing village on Maine's south coast, Bicknell spent time with Lyme artists Walter Griffin, Arthur Heming, and Charles Ebert at Monhegan Island. Bicknell maintained a life-long connection to Lyme through the home left to him as a bequest by the artist Lewis Cohen, a fellow Griswold House boarder.&quot;","Other Bain/LOC photos of the Beaux Arts Society's Venetian Pageant, at the Hotel Astor, February 20, 1914:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583275/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583415/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865582597/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583077/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583559/in/photostream/]","More Bain/LOC photos of performers in the Beaux Arts Society's Venetian Pageant:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4866202530/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865584169/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865584485/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583995/]","Thank you to all for research into this interesting event!

In October 1944, when Germany occupied Hungary, the Wittelsbachs were arrested and imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Oranienburg, Brandenburg. In April 1945 they were moved to the Dachau concentration camp, where they were liberated by the United States Army. Albrecht became Head of the Royal Family of Bavaria with the death of his father on 2 August 1955. From that date he was regarded by Jacobites as the rightful King of England, Scotland, Ireland and France.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht,_Duke_of_Bavaria\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht,_Duke_of_Bavaria</a>","ah I love how you can tell the photo has been dodged!

Were they no longer needed as evidence? Why not melt them down as scrap metal? The rifle barrels look like they've been deliberately bent.","Some police agencies nowadays do send the confiscated guns to be melted down for scrap -- often on an annual basis. Usually the agency collecting the guns from various jurisdictions is a State Police force. The guns have been used in crimes, or seized during domestic quarrels, or voluntarily surrendered by members of the public. The order to destroy them comes from a judge, often at the end of a criminal trial. Sometimes, if a weapon is unusual, a police agency will ask the judge for permission to keep the weapon for training purposes, or for use by a SWAT team. In Connecticut, until 1992, confiscated guns were not scrapped, but sold to the public at auction.","Another Bain/LOC photo shows a high-ranking police officer throwing these guns into the sea:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818636438/in/photostream/]\n\nYet another Bain/LOC photo of the forfeited guns aboard ship:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4909923045/in/photostream/]","Thanks for the background info, Wystan!","they look old :)","Are you referring to the guns or Wystan and myself?  \n\n(couldn't resist!)","I will not carry a gun....

So, is this DePalma? Might be -- and maybe he was planning to repeat his feat now, in 1914?\n\nBraender Bulldog tires were manufactured by a company in East Rutherford, New Jersey, that had been founded in 1912 by Philip Braender, a German immigrant. (When Braender died in 1916, he left a million bucks to his wife and children. The tire company continued on into the 1920s.)\n\ntechnogeo points out that this photo was taken by an Indianapolis studio -- so, presumably in Indianapolis. De Palma won the Indy 500 race in 1915 (and nearly won in 1912) driving a Mercedes racer. He won other races elsewhere as well, in Mercedes.\n\nHis Wikipedia bio includes a photo of him with his riding mechanic, Tom Alley, in his 1912 Indy car.

Marked by poor planning, inadequate equipment, and a surfeit of bad luck, the expedition was harrowing, to put it mildly, and TR nearly died (as in fact another in the party did) -- but ultimately in 1914 he and his son, Kermit, and others on the trek returned to the embrace of civilization. (And the River of Doubt now bears the name Rio Roosevelt.) Roosevelt lived to write a book about his ordeal, &quot;Through the Brazilian Wilderness.&quot; The story has recently been updated and retold in a gripping bestseller (2005) by Candice Millard -- &quot;The River of Doubt; Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey,&quot; a book that comes highly recommended by its many readers, myself included.\n\nTR's own memoir of the ordeal is available to readers online, via Google Books.","here is quite a bit of info on the trip and even some video and these images\n\n<a href=\"http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trbrazil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trbrazil.html</a>","More Bain/LOC photos of Roosevelt in Rio:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818010687/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635152/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818010869/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818012045/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818011081/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818011373/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818011549/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818012247/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818012421/]","here is quite a bit of info on the trip and even some video and these images\n\n<a href=\"http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trbrazil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trbrazil.html</a>","Dr. Lauro Muller was the Brazilian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.","More Bain/LOC photos of Roosevelt in Rio:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635152/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818010687/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818010869/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818012045/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818011373/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818011081/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818634314/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818012247/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818012421/]","Wystan:  Thanks for Dr. Miller's first name here.

In return for $25,000, he agreed to keep other film companies from his battlefield, to fight in daylight whenever possible, and to reconstruct battles if the footage needed reshooting. \n\n&quot;Now the subject of an HBO film starring Antonio Banderas (And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself), Villa is one of the main protagonists in Margarita de Orellana's vivid account of the American movie industry's fascination with the events of the Mexican Revolution. \n\n&quot;Through memoir accounts, newspaper reports, and analysis of the films themselves, &quot;Filming Pancho&quot; reveals much about how Mexico was constructed in the American imagination and how the film images reinforced and justified American expansionism and racial and social prejudices.&quot;\n\n--From a description, on Amazon, of a documentary movie of Hollywood's treatment of the Mexican Revolution.

Repp and his unusual trick car, dubbed “Maude the Motor Mule”, often performed at race meets – he astonished spectators by making his car run on its “hind legs”, spinning it around, bucking it into the air and generally making the car behave like a circus horse or mule. The Buick had a heavy weight hung over the rear end of the vehicle, concealed beneath a housing, and had individual brakes on each rear wheel. The driver controlled the position of the weight with a lever – deliberately overbalancing the car by moving the weight and making the vehicle buck into the air. Applying one of the independent brakes and locking one of the wheels then allowed the car to spin around on that wheel. The exhibition was often performed in time to music from an accompanying band which played a waltz.&quot;","A three-paragraph item about Roy Repp and his Buick appeared, with a photograph, in Popular Science Monthly, volume 87 (December 1915).\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=6s3uaaaamaaj&amp;pg=pa782&amp;lpg=pa782&amp;dq=roy+repp+australia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ky6sy0akfc&amp;sig=gu-sxnzvsqvhk6j_yccmchdtuwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l5w_tonvcnk0ngev87tubw&amp;sa=x&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0ccgq6aewbq#v=onepage&amp;q=roy\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=6s3uaaaamaaj&amp;pg=pa782&amp;l...</a> repp&amp;f=false\n\nA follow-up item appeared in the January, 1916 issue, (volume 88), on page 87.

I'd guess that this scene was set up by the American photographer to show the folks back home how strange/primitive these Italians were. I'm half Italian and if this wasn't an historical document I'd find it wholly offensive.","Alan Denney, I hope you will understand Italian well, because my english is too bad :o) The picture could be offensive, but... do you remember the famous italian comedian-actors Toto e Peppino ?? Si lo so, noi come lo spero anche voi negli USA non abbiamo mai mangiato con le mani gli spaghetti, ma qualcuno forse, per povertà, l'avrà fatto. Questa immagine, come le commedie di Toto e Peppino, sono delle caricature comiche, una rappresentazione folkloristica di un modo di vivere italiano. Sarebbe infatti necessario, e questo potresti scriverlo meglio tu, dire che sono appunto immagini che rappresentano vizi e abitudini in modo grottesco e scherzoso, ma non sono la rappresentazione della vita reale.","Grazie Wozz (- l'atra meta e inglese e abito a Londra). \nWozz points out that that this image is in the same genre as the comic carictures of Neapolitan entertainers like Toto and Peppino and that as such they aren't a faithful representation of real life. I agree but it's one thing for an Italian audience to consume such images and quite another for them to be presented in a US publication for a non-Italian audience which would not have been able to make such a nuanced reading as Wozz proposes.My point is that we are more likely to have a positive view of foreigners if  ourperception of them is not based on comic caricatures. These days we're floooded with images of people from all over the world but when this image was disseminated it may well have been the only picture many people had seen of Italians.","Alan, you're right.","A century ago, common usage in the USA was to call all pasta &quot;macaroni&quot;.","[http://www.flickr.com/photos/alandenney/] You're looking at an image from the late 19th century, when it was still absolutely common to attach human zoos to World's Fairs to show the visitors how &quot;primitive tribes&quot; behaved in their habitat, including the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago with its famed Midway Plaisance. Also, the print originates in Switzerland  &ndash; Photoglob Z&uuml;rich, the original publisher, routinely purchased black &amp; white photos  from local photographers in bulk to turn into color photochroms, so chances are this is is how a Neapolitan photographer saw his hometown. The Detroit Publishing Co. was simply the North American licensee. PZ captioned most of its prints in the local language to add some local flair, but as you can see from the many comments in this set, they often enough got it wrong...","Bellissimo","Joining the conversation a few years later, I found an entry in the scholarly Encyclopedia of Pasta by Oretta Zanini De Vita, which says that poor workers eating pasta with cheese by hand was a common sight in Naples during and after the 18th century, when pasta was finally cheap enough for the poor to eat.\n\nAccording to de Vita:  &quot;Grand Tour travelers to Naples watched with amusement the daily meal of the so-called lazzari, at the street corners, who with a deft movement of the fingers, slid maccheroni dressed with cheese into their mouths.&quot;\n\nThe maccheroni in use was not the macaroni of  America, but was similar to bucatini, long, straight, and with a hole in the middle.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=D5nXAbSifIgC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;ots=qNHic4t-Pe&amp;dq=maccheronaio&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=their%20mouths&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=D5nXAbSifIgC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;ot...</a>\n\n\nLOC:  One improvement that can be made in your online presentation of the Photochroms is to include the caption on the print itself in your Notes.  Instead, it looks like you have in all cases used an identification that  comes from the American publisher's catalog.  In some cases, like this one, the English translation is wrong and/or misleading.  Trialanderrors, above, touches on this too.\nAlso, researchers who have the print and want to use the caption to search online cannot reach it in your collection.  I think you should add the captions, though I'm sure that is not a simple project.","The original caption of the photochrome is „NAPOLI . MACCHERONAIO“. It seems, that the maccheronaio was a popular topic on postcards from naples at that time, showing people producing, selling or eating pasta.

Natera was also present (because he was trying to confer Carranza in Sonora, but American authorities declined to let him pass through El Paso).  Villa proposed Toribio Ortega, or as a courtesy, Pánfilo Natera to take command of the army.  The generals chose Natera.  The column departed from Chihuahua on December 22, 1913.  On January 2, 1914 villistas were on sight to Ojinaga, on January 4ht town was attacked without success.  Then Villa took command of the army.  His plan was a nocturnal raid: Rosalío Hernandes by the south; Maclovio Herrera and Trinidad Rodríguez  by east; by the West Toribio Ortega. On January 11th at sunset, the raids went simultaneously.   The federals (huertistas), leaving fire arms, crossed Rio Bravo and surrendered to American authorities. Villa and his revolutionary army stayed in Ojinaga three or four days, then they returned to Chihuahua.  (Pedro Salmerón, La División Del Norte).

A pince-nez had no arms or temples and clipped on the bridge of the nose. It was held in place by either spring powered nose guard grips in the fingerpiece type or a spring bridge with nose guard grips in the hoopspring or C bridge type. Properly fitted, a pince-nez remained securely attached to the bridge of the nose at all times and was very comfortable even during full time wear. Eyeglasses (pince-nez) and spectacles (glasses with temples) : were unisex then. The terms eyeglasses and spectacles had distinct meanings. The rimless type was the most popular and stylish for all ages. For soldiers,it was great for wear under a gas mask or goggles and army officials stated the a pince-nez was the ideal eyewear. \nSee Pince-nez Renaissance blog/site the only place on the web or anywhere for very detailed,accurate info re: pince-nez.Click on table of contents.

Collett resigned from his engineering post with the Union Pacific Railroad, to become Director of Public Works for the Dominican Republic, during the U. S. intervention in Santo Domingo. Collett's appointment came at the time of the removal, apparently for political reasons, of W. W. Russell, the American Minister to the D. R., and his replacement with a political crony of William Jennings Bryan, Secretary of State in the Woodrow Wilson administration. At this time, U. S. officials had control of administative appointments in Santo Domingo, and apparently discovered ways to turn them to pecuniary advantage.\nA. J. Collett was a beneficiary.\n\n&quot;Every member of the American side of the Dominican customs force but one . . . has been removed and replaced by appintments of the new administration. With John L.

Collett of Mr. Bryan's own state of Nebraska, son-in-law of his old political crony, Mayor &quot;Jim&quot; Dahlman of Omaha. \n\n&quot;The Dominican Government has not yet indicated its assent to the nomination of Mr. Collett, and it is known that it resents what it considers an application of the American spoils system with salaries paid by Santo Domingo.&quot;\n\n---Story in the New York Times, December 12, 1913.
