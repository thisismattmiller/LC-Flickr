According to friends, Amundsen will send them to Christiania, Norway, to be educated. They are Cakonita, eight-years-old, and Camille, twelve-years-old. Amundsen found them near the coast of Wrangell Land. During his last trip, Capt. Amundsen encountered unprecedented ice jams which made such trouble that his ship was pinned in the ice near Cape Serge on the northern coast of Siberia. There he came into contact with native tribes, eking a precarious living by hunting and fishing. One of the little girls came first to his attention because she was starving. Amundsen took care of the children and fed and clothed them. They were so responsive he soon became greatly attached to them and before he left he obtained permission of their parents to adopt them.&quot;","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen</a>\n&quot;Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen (UK: /ˈɑːmʊndsən/, US: /-məns-/; 16 July 1872 – c. 18 June 1928) was a Norwegian explorer of polar regions and a key figure of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. He led the first expedition to traverse the Northwest Passage by sea, from 1903 to 1906, and the first expedition to the South Pole in 1911. He led the first expedition proven to have reached the North Pole in 1926. He disappeared while taking part in a rescue mission for the airship Italia in 1928.&quot;\n\n&quot;During the third winter, Maud was frozen in the western Bering Strait. She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching Seattle, in the American Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs. Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order. He took with him two young indigenous girls, a four-year-old he adopted, Kakonita, and her companion Camilla. When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla's father, who lived in eastern Russia.&quot;","See also similar photo in the New-York tribune.

By the time Shilkret was 18, he was a member of the New York Philharmonic; he would also play with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and in Arthur Pryor's Band. In 1915, Shilkret began working for Victor as an arranger and conductor, yet did not earn a credit on records until 1921 when he teamed with drummer and Victor executive Eddie King to form the Shilking Orchestra. The silly name was retired after only three records, but the basic 8-10 musicians who made up the Shilking continued on under Shilkret's direction, producing numerous popular music selections to suit Victor's various needs.

She attended the Rayson School for Girls (NYC) and studied piano under Louis Stillman before moving to France ~1921. In 1923 she married Ignacio de Coll Castell, heir to a Spanish brewing conglomerate (Damm, brewers of La Bohemia) and moved to Barcelona.\n\nThen her life got complicated.  She may be of current interest because of the legal wranglings surrounding citizenship of her son Fernando Coll Picard. As quoted on <a rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Leagle.com</a> in the opinion on a later case . . . \n\n<blockquote>In the case of Fernando Jorge Coll y Picard the opinion of the Attorney General of the United States (37 Op.Atty. Gen. 90) concerned a child born in Spain in 1927 to a native American woman who had been married in 1923 to a Spanish citizen and returned to the United States with her minor child and secured a divorce in 1931 and the decree awarded her custody of the child. It was the determination of the Attorney General that the child in that case had derived United States citizenship under the provisions of Section 5 of the Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1229, which provided that a child born without the United States of alien parents shall be deemed a citizen by virtue of the naturalization of or resumption of American citizenship by the parent, provided such naturalization or resumption takes place during the minority of the child, the citizenship to begin at the time such minor child begins to reside permanently in the United States. The Attorney General wrote:\n\n<i>While under Section 5 of that statute Congress is dealing with cases of resumption of American citizenship, there seems to be no good reason for supposing that the Congress intended to decline to grant citizenship to the minor child merely because its mother never lost her American citizenship, having married after the effective date of the Act of 1922 [42 Stat. 1022]. I think, therefore, that so far as the citizenship of her children is concerned, Mrs. de Coll should be treated as in precisely the same situation as one who had resumed her citizenship.</i></blockquote>\n\nShe later married Joseph Marshall Haight of Philadelphia (died 1965) and, in 1966, married Theodore Tweedy White, Jr. in NY.","[https://www.flickr.com/photos/90124154@N00] Good catch.","Thanks for the information.

It was built in mediterranean architecture of cream-colored walls, with brick trim, accented with arched windows and an overhanging roof of ceramic red tiles. A large wooden door, trimmed with studded nail heads and a carved brass handle, opened into an entrance hall.\n\nOn November 5, 1921 President Warren C. Harding pressed a button in the White House in Washington, D.C. which officially opened the RCA Radio Central facilities at Rocky Point. Radio Central was considered the largest transmitting station in the world.\n\nOriginally, long waves were used, resulting in the construction of six 410 high steel towers. The towers were 410’ high with added cross-arm of 40’ high, extending the total height to 450’. The tall height of the structures was necessary for the long distance, worldwide type of radio communications. The twelve towers, which were 1260 apart, covered a two and a half mile area.\n\nTower #1 remained standing tall, with its flashing red beacon guiding planes and ships, served as an aviation beacon light for another sixteen years.

Many indeed do not draw the comparison as meekly as that but give blunt preference the Londoners. They have not, perhaps, the absolute finish and gloss that lies over the style of the Flonzaleys, but they are four interesting individual artists, enthusiastic, poetic, lively.</blockquote>\nOr, according to Irving Kolodin (as quoted on the LSQ wiki page)\n<blockquote>'In the Flonzaley's later years,... they seemed to have become a committee of experts matching exquisite swatches of tonal texture rather than performers of music. For young ears, the rise of the London String Quartet (with the incomparable James Levey as leader, and the enduring partnership of Thomas Petre, H. Waldo Warner and C. Warwick Evans participating) dimmed the Flonzaley star even as it was waning.

Working with the tempestuous Garden, Polacco -- despite several voluble conflicts with his &quot;directa&quot; -- filled the position more than honorably. From the November 14, 1921, production of Samson et Dalila through the time of his retirement for health reasons in 1930, the conductor concentrated on his work in Chicago, conducting just one year (1927) in Boston. During his Chicago tenure, Polacco confirmed his outstanding grasp of a wide-ranging repertory and an unflagging ability to light fires under nearly any cast. He often conducted Garden, notably in her French repertory and in Strauss' Salome. Polacco's final Chicago performance found him leading Garden's Mélisande on February 1, 1930. </blockquote>\n\nFor more on Garden see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3066027708/]","They arrived on October 21, 1921, s.

A lawsuit ensued and the completed and fully-equipped building was placed on the market. Three businesses – Steak King International, Taco Villa and Joe’s Meat Market – opened and closed there before 1973, when South Seas Restaurant opened at that location.\n\nThe new Chinese-American eatery found itself with a perfecty good, nearly-new eye-catching display sign towering over its parking. Unfortunately, it depicted a clearly Mexican man perching in a cactus.  Whether inspired by thrift, Happy Hour, or weird sense of humor, someone “fixed” the former Taco King sign by giving its inhabitant a makeover, modifing his headgear, facial hair and eye shape to look more Asian. The end result didn’t achieve its goal but was memorable.

Early in 1922, his government collapsed, and he was replaced as Prime Minister by Luigi Facta, amidst the Fascist insurgency led by Benito Mussolini.

Main St., 5FN.2284, Dr. Morgan Office, ca. 1927 (Photograph 37) This plain, one-story brown brick building with flat roof has some characteristics of the Mediterranean Revival style. The front façade (south side) has a central entrance with brick arch and inset wood door with three stepped lights. Flanking the entrance are flat arch plate-glass windows with brick sills. There is a center flat parapet above the entrance and projecting piers at each end of the wall. Between the piers and the parapet are slanting bands of metal tile. At the top and bottom of the wall are contrasting courses of red brick.  Alterations. A 1981 survey photo shows the same door but the window openings have glass block; neither are believed to be original. The date the original windows and door were removed is unknown. Historic Background. A previous building on this site was removed by 1926, when Sanborn maps show the parcel to be vacant. The current building is shown on a 1949 map. In 1955, Dr. A.W. Morgan, an osteopath and surgeon, had his office here and in 1957, Bramer &amp; Tull Optometrists were located here. In 1964, the Florence Chamber of Commerce had offices here, and Anthony Scutti was the secretary and manager for the organization. The 1981 survey found that the building was used as an annex of the First National Bank of Florence. Rocky Mountain Bank &amp; Trust began utilizing the building in the early 2000s. &quot;","Some brickwork came down.

I think you have identified the Aeromarine &quot;Waldorf&quot; cleanly but I was not able to link the name 'Waldorf&quot; of this flying boat to the Model 85. There seems to be only an incomplete list of names of the ca. 15 Model 85 flying boats, about 7 names are identified but not the &quot;Waldorf&quot;.","Thank you for the comment, Kees.\n\nLooking into this deeper, I came across some information that should secure <i>Waldorf</i>'s identity as an Aeromarine Model 85 flying boat.\n\nAt <a href=\"http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/aeromfl.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">The Aeromarine Website</a>, <i>Waldorf</i> is identified as an &quot;Aeromarine Model 85/80&quot; among a list of aircraft operated by the airline. Both types of aircraft were modified surplus HS-2L flying boats, but the Model 80 could be distinguished from Model 85 by the Model 80's addition of an enclosed passenger cabin (which <i>Waldorf</i> lacks). \n\nFurther, just a bit of circumstantial evidence, all of the Aeromarine Airways' aircraft named after famous hotels and captured in photos - <i>Ambassador, McAlpin, Vanderbilt,</i> and <i>Biltmore</i> - were Model 85s, like <i>Waldorf</i>.\n\nHowever, the best evidence as to <i>Waldorf</i>'s type is a two-page Aeromarine advertisement in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UY9MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=aeromarine+\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\"><i>Aviation and Aircraft Journal</i>, February 7, 1921, Vol. X, No. 6, on pages 173-174</a>. \n\nThe ad illustrates the company's line of surplus HS-2L (and derived) aircraft, including the Model 85 as &quot;Aeromarine-Navy HS-2-L, Six Seat. Open Cockpit Flying Boat, Model No. 85,&quot; and &quot;Aeromarine-Navy HS-2-L, Enclosed Cabin De Luxe Flying Limousine, Model No. 80.&quot;  As an aside, this ad is in the middle of a pretty interesting article about the company, spanning pages 171-176.\n\nAs best I can tell, from The Aeromarine Website, contemporary direct sources - like the company's advertisements, the configuration of the aircraft, etc., the best available evidence points to <i>Waldorf</i> being a Model 85 flying boat.","Thanks for your research,  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/25695066@N00] and  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/varese2002] .

From several newspaper advertisements, I'm pretty certain Woolworth's address was 5248 Lankershim Blvd. In the mid 1980's that whole area was torn down and rebuilt so it looks nothing like it used to. After consulting some maps, I believe that road in the foreground is McCormick St., which now dead ends at a parking garage, but before the reconstruction crossed over to Lankershim. That would make sense with the photo you linked to if it was taken at Lankershim and Magnolia, it would then be looking toward the Woolworth's and McCormack St. \n\nIf anyone confirm this or correct me, please do.","Woolworth's address was 5248 Lankershim, on the corner of McCormick.

Serving in academia as a chemistry professor to begin his career, Herty concurrently promoted collegiate athletics including creating the first varsity football team at the University of Georgia. His academic research gravitated towards applied chemistry where he revolutionized the turpentine industry in the United States. While serving as the president of the American Chemical Society, Herty became a national advocate for the nascent American chemical industry and left academia to preside over the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers' Association (SOCMA) and the Chemical Foundation. He was also instrumental in the creation of the National Institutes of Health. Towards the end of his career, Herty's research and advocacy led to the creation of a new pulp industry in the Southern United States that utilized southern pine trees to create newsprint.&quot;","<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Arthur_Jones\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Arthur_Jones</a>\n&quot;Henry Arthur Jones (20 September 1851 – 7 January 1929) was an English dramatist.

About 2,000 Chinese merchants from all parts of the country are expected to attend, and many of them have already arrived. Sightseers and Chinese visitors filled the streets around the new building, from which came strange music until late in the night.\n\n&quot;The new clubhouse will be formally opened at noon today, but preliminary exercises began yesterday afternoon.  More than 500 members and their guests gathered in the assembly hall in the upper floor of the building, where speeches were made by Gong Wah and Yee H.

Last night the guests were feasted, and there was more speechmaking.&quot;   <i> – <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/10/01/98748762.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">The New York Times</a></i>\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;","<i>&quot;The story behind the story&quot;</i> – what really went on behind all the flag-waving at the Chinese Merchants' Association&quot; (opinion lede by Pixel Wrangler)\n\nThis was the Chinatown headquarters of On Leong, also known as the Chinese Merchants Association at 41 Mott Street, New York City, not to be confused with the Merchants’ Association building, built in 1950 at 2150 Rockwell Ave.\n\nThe On Leong tong was one of two brutal criminal syndicates that warred for control of Chinatown in the first decade of the new century.  The other rival syndicate was Hip Sing Tong.\n\n&quot;At stake were the payouts from the many gambling and opium dens as well as the brothels that made Chinatown a major lure not just for other Chinese immigrants but also for white New Yorkers, too.&quot;\n\n&quot;In recent years the Tong has been linked to the Ghost Shadows street gang led by Wing Yeung Chan. Currently, there are over 30,000 registered On Leong members, the majority of them with a commercial or industrial background.&quot; [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Leong_Chinese_Merchants_Association\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">1</a>]\n\nRead more, as well as see a reprint of this photograph in the <i><a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/tong-wars-reveals-feuding-gangs-chinatown-article-1.2714292\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">New York Daily News</a></i> excerpt of &quot;Tong Wars: The Untold Story of Vice, Money and Murder in New York's Chinatown,&quot; by Scott D.

A number of the mature trees on site were planted when the building was dedicated in 1929. The majority of the landscaping is contained within a semi-formal garden that frames a series of terraced lawn areas approaching the west façade where a public stage provides an outdoor performance venue. The landscape architect designed this series of terraced lawns to provide for public presentations, gatherings, community functions, debates and civic interaction. Among the plantings are 57 varieties of palms, Coast Redwoods (Sequoia Sempervirens), Saucer Magnolia (Magnolia X Soulangiana), and Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron Giganteum).\nThe general design and layout of the courthouse follow a modified Spanish castle plan. The building is placed on the site so the most important rooms face south for natural heat gain to warm these spaces. There are many castle defensive elements used on the Santa Barbara County Courthouse. The architect used these Andalusian-Spanish castle elements as metaphorical connections to the Spanish roots of Santa Barbara and many of the design details are also metaphoric of castle defense elements. The courthouse is the seat of government for Santa Barbara County, much like a castle is the seat of its ruler.\nThe courthouse complex is comprised of four buildings connected by either a bridge or arch, taking an overall form much like a capital &quot;L.&quot; Because these buildings were constructed at the same time and are interconnected by arches and bridges, they are considered one building for the purpose of the National Historic Landmark designation.\nThe main façade of the building that faces Anacapa Street (south) stretches across the site some 370 feet. The Figueroa Street façade (east) is 356 feet and the Santa Barbara Street façade (north) is 161 feet. The building height varies from 40 feet up to 111 feet. The site changes in elevation by as much as four feet, dropping to the East. The sunken gardens drop below the level of the main arch entry paving by six feet.\nThe general &quot;L&quot; shape of the building protects the garden (also called a &quot;bailey,&quot; in castle terms). The clock tower observation deck (El Mirador or &quot;keep,&quot; in castle terms) rises 88 feet above the ground entry level. This height provides the best defensive vantage point across the garden, the main entrance, and outer points in the approach of the courthouse. The Rotunda, located at the intersection of the Anacapa and Figueroa wings, provides access to the alarm bell located at the outside southeast corner of the building. The northeast corner of the courthouse is defended by means of a turret with lancets, machicolations and embrasures.\n\nArchitect: William Moser and William Moser, Jr.\nArchitectural Style: Spanish Colonial Revival\nProperty Type: Courthouse\nOriginal Use: courthouse &quot;","Thanks for helping identify this building @swanq!

The State Capital Publishing Museum opened in 1983. In the 1990s and again in the 2000s, budget cuts led to the trimming of staff and programs at the museum, and unexpected building-maintenance problems in 2012 led to a decision to close the museum indefinitely.

It was completed in the spring of 1889 at an estimated cost of $125,000. Designed by Chicago Architect W.W. Boyington, this building was heavily financed by Marcus Daly, mining magnate and patron of the Smelter City. Using a composite style of French Renaissance and Romanesque architecture, the hotel was a 120 feet square, four story structure built of local red brick with terra cotta ornamentation. The building sits 10 feet back from the Main Street sidewalk and features a 34 foot wide central arched entrance resting on terra cotta columns with a pediment above. The hotel interior included a full basement equipped with a servant's dining room, a laundry, boilers, and a dynamo for electric light generation. The first and second floors, finished in red oak and eastern pine, contained the main dining room, a ladies' ordinary, billiard hall, drug store, and barber shop. After Marcus Daly died in 1900, the Montana Hotel underwent extensive remodeling, costing $96,000 under the ownership of the Anaconda Company. In 1954, the building was purchased by Edison and Bell, Inc. of Kalispell, MT. The firm operated the hotel until 1959 at which time plans for demolition were considered. To combat this action, citizens of Anaconda formed the Montana Hotel Corporation and purchased the structure, renaming it the Marcus Daly Hotel. A restoration project was undertaken in 1964 and a modern motel unit was built to the rear of the original structure. In 1975, heavy financial burdens and potential bankruptcy faced the Montana Hotel Corporation and the building was sold to a local developer in 1976. An aggressive program of structural renovation was begun, including the removal of the hotel's two upper stories. The remaining space will be used for retail and office space.&quot;","Thanks for locating this additional information, Swanq!","Still a B&amp;B.

The Boy Scout organization is to assist the U.S. Army Air Service in the preparation of this route by clearing the landing fields selected and establishing proper identification markers on them. There were a number of very distinguished people present, prominent among them were Brig. Gen. William Mitchell, Mr. Huston Thompson, Mr. Isaac Gans, Mr. Edward D. Shaw, Mr. A.G. Batchelder and others.\n\nAfter the huge marker &quot;D.C. 1&quot; had been laid and whitewashed by the Boy Scouts a talk on what air transportation means now and in the future and how the airways of the United States serve the airplane just as the road ways serve the automobile was given by Brig. Gen. William Mitchell. . . .</blockquote>\nThis photo, also just posted by the LoC, of General William &quot;Billy&quot; Mitchell (US Army Air Service), would also seem to tie in to the aforementioned event.

William D. Coney of the 91st Aero Squadron completed a transcontinental flight of 22.5 hours flying time from Rockwell Field, California, to Pablo Beach, Florida, in a DeHavilland DH-4, which carried enough fuel for 14 hours of flight. However he had left Rockwell on February 21 intending to complete the flight within 24 hours, making just one stop in Dallas, Texas, but was thwarted by bad weather and engine problems. One month later, taking off at 1:00 a.m. of March 25, he repeated the attempt going in the opposite direction, but developed engine problems while flying low in a fog near Crowville, Louisiana, southeast of Monroe. He crashed into a tree trying to land and was severely injured, dying five days later in a Natchez, Mississippi hospital.</i>\n\nSee also:\n<a href=\"https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/william-devoe-coney/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/william-devoe-coney/</a>","Cool 😎","This photo was published in the Bisbee daily review., February 22, 1921, Image 1 (with article ARMY AVIATOR HOPS OFF IN ATTEMPT TO FLY ACROSS COUNTRY IN 2 HOURS) <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024827/1921-02-22/ed-1/seq-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024827/1921-02-22/ed-...</a>\nand in the Evening star.

Vacated in  1972, the structure is  now used by the Royal Athletic Company.\n\nDescription\nThis brick structure is  a one-story building placed on a half-story basement demarcated with a  concrete water table and string course, faced in a  decorative yellow-orange burnt brick, known locally as Yankton brick', the telephone building is  three bays on the front facade. Capped with a  cement pediment and acanthus leaf, the cornice bears a  1908 date stone. The door and windows have been altered. The brass plaque reading &quot;Telephone Building&quot; remains intact.\n\nSignificance: architecture, communications, business\nMany small towns retain their early telephone buildings, which are often pleasant and architecturally witty, small scale structures. This building was built to the scale of the mid-nineteenth century Yankton commercial buildings. It emphasizes its distinct function both through the simplicity and boldness of its design and through the use of the striking, decorative brick commonly found in foundations and industrial structures in southeastern South Dakota.&quot;","Thanks for the update,  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05] .

After building this property and practicing for a few years, he left Beatrice in 1886 to return to Nebraska City where he remained a gentleman farmer supplementing his income with a sizable inheritance. \n It has display windows on either side of a recessed entry and a glass transom above as part of its storefront. Two identifiable window fenestrations are blocked over with stucco on the second story and a decorative gabled cornice with brackets and finials finishes the façade. The building name is integrated under the gabled cornice between the two center brackets.  The building was constructed in 1886.  An original bay window was removed in the early 1980s after structural failure. Everett Druggists and Sundries was the main commercial occupant of this building during its renovation in the 1960s.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/16000481.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/16000481.pdf</a>","See\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/43815747834/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/43815747834/</a>","B-59:  Thanks for linking to the history of this building on the other photo of it from the Margolies collection.

The Washington was the fourth of four Colorado-class Battleships (Colorado(BB-45), Maryland(BB-46), West Virginia(BB-48)).  The USS Washington was however never completed because she was still under construction when the Washington Naval Treaty was signed on Sixth of February 1922.  Work on the USS Washington ceased on the Eighth of February 1922 with the ship being just over 75% completed.  Just over Twenty months later in November of 1924 the unfinished Washington was towed to off the Capes of Virgina and used as a gunnery target ships and was sunk by the fire from 14” guns of the USS New York(BB-34) and the USS Texas(BB-35). The use of the USS Washington as a gunnery target ship did provide valuable information about hull protection armor for future classes of United States Battleships.
