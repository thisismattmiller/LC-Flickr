Ghiberti's work took decades to accomplish, was hailed as the early masterpiece of Renaissance art, and later furnished inspiration to Michaelangelo. (In 1956, when I saw the doors, they were still attached to the Baptistry, where for five hundred years they had been exposed to the possibility of vandalism, and the ravages of time and weather, but in 1990, at long last, they were removed for protection to a nearby museum, and replaced by modern replicas.)\n\nGhiberti's &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; [Michaelangelo's term for them]:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ricardobevilaqua/2601068466/]\n\nMuch later, in the United States, Ghiberti's doors furnished inspiration for the 19th-century &quot;Columbus Doors&quot; on the Capitol, in Washington -- doors which depict scenes of the quest for India and discovery of America, by Christopher Columbus, in 1492 (only a few decades after Ghiberti finished his doors). These doors, which lack the finesse and genius of Ghiberti's, were the work of Randolph Rogers, an American-born sculptor (chiefly of Civil War monuments), whose studio and workshop were located in Rome.","From 1897. The Florence motifs in the collection are sadly quite lackluster.

Grazie, Buona giornata.","This is what Bing translator came up with:\nI think the correct title is &quot;spaghetti eaters&quot;. First because it's spaghetti, not Macaroni (so called American maccaroni). 2nd I do not think that they have a sales counter, rather a dish to eat. And it is therefore logical to imagine that this picture is a playful parody of the much more famous painting Dutch &quot;potato eaters&quot;.\nIf you fancy you translate my comment in English. Thanks, have a nice day.","The original caption of the photochrome is „NAPOLI . MACCHERONAIO“.

He first checked into the Battle Creek Sanitarium in January, 1911.\n\nProhibitionist and Vegetarian Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a Seventh-Day Adventist, was the eccentric dictator of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. (His brother, Will K. Kellogg, started the Kellogg's cereal company -- beginning with corn flakes -- as an offshoot of the Sanitarium's work in developing health foods. C. W. Post, a patient at the &quot;San,&quot; also liked the bland diet there, and became the multi-millionaire owner of the Post Cereals Company.)\n\nSamuel Sidney McClure (1857-1949) was the founder of the McClure Newspaper Syndicate and editor-publisher of McClure's Magazine, a muckraking organ of the Progressive movement, from 1893 to 1911. Through his magazine, McClure boosted recognition and acceptance of the early-childhood educational theories of Maria Montessori. &quot;He is a firm believer in the value of the low-protein diet, which he claims has doubled his ability for work and quadrupled his endurance. . . .&quot;\n\nIriving Fisher (1867-1947) was an American economist, health reformer, and eugenicist. When he contracted TB, he &quot;took the cure&quot; at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and afterwards became a health reformer himself. He introduced the practice of calorie counting as part of a diet regimen. He was also a Prohibitionist: Prohibition of alcohol was a major tenet of the Seventh Day Adventists and of Dr. Kellogg's Sanitarium.\n\nSir H.

The process became known as &quot;Fletcherizing,&quot; and the word &quot;Fletcherize&quot; entered the dictionaries (at least briefly).","&quot;Pinchot . . . long suffered from problems of the eye, skin and digestive system. In January 1911 he enrolled in the John Harvey Kellogg Sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan. The notion of preventive medicine -- staying well rather than getting cured -- was innovative, and the high-mindedness of Kellogg's program, which centered on obedience to natural law as a moral duty, obviously appealed to Pinchot. Kellogg's ban on alcohol and tobacco would not have been a problem, but Pinchot had a sweet tooth and probably thought twice about the restriction on chocolate.&quot;\n--intro to The Conservation Diaries of Gifford Pinchot, edited by Harold K.

Taft in the Hudson River off New York City on 14 October 1912, and received a visit from the Chief Executive that day. She then transported President Taft to the Panama Canal Zone for an inspection of the unfinished isthmian waterway. After putting the inspection party ashore, Arkansas sailed to Cuban waters for shakedown training. She then returned to the Canal Zone on 26 December to carry President Taft to Key West, Fla.\n\n&quot;Following this assignment, Arkansas joined the Atlantic Fleet for maneuvers along the east coast. The battleship began her first overseas cruise in late October 1913, and visited several ports in the Mediterranean. At Naples, Italy, on 11 November 1913, the ship celebrated the birthday of the King of Italy. Earlier in October 1913, a coup in Mexico had brought to power a dictator, Victoriano Huerta. The way in which Huerta had come to power, however, proved contrary to the idealism of President Woodrow Wilson, who insisted on a representative government, rather than a dictatorial one, south of the American-Mexican border. Mexico had been in turmoil for several years, and the United States Navy maintained a force of ships in those waters ready to protect American lives.&quot;","This is sooo beautiful!","Very, very classy!","John Harvey Kellogg (1852-1943), doctor, inventor of corn flakes.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg</a>","Prohibitionist and Vegetarian, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg was the man who built the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and presided there for decades.

John and Will later argued over the recipe for the cereals (Will wanted to add sugar to the flakes). So in 1906, Will started his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which eventually became the Kellogg Company, triggering a decades-long feud. John then formed the Battle Creek Food Company to develop and market soy  products.\n\nThe Kelloggs did not invent the concept of the dry breakfast cereal. That honor belongs to Dr. James Caleb Jackson, who created the first dry breakfast cereal in 1863, which he called, &quot;Granula.&quot; A patient of John's, Charles William Post, would eventually start his own dry cereal company, Post Cereals, selling a rival brand of corn flakes. Dr. Kellogg later would claim that Charles Post stole the formula for corn flakes from his safe in the Sanitarium office.","Gerald Carson (1899-1989) told the whole convoluted story of the Kellogg brothers, their rise to fame, and their prickly relationship in his book, &quot;Cornflake Crusade&quot; (1957).

(2) He interviewed over a hundred educators, intellectuals and businessmen about the project. On March 22, 1911, the Committee of Three (JDR Jr., Paul Warburg and Starr Murphy) met and organized the Bureau of Social Hygiene.

Editing an image undermines the reliability of the photo as a historical document. Once we start covering up even small scratches, who's to know how much other image content we changed.\n \nSubjective choices: Different users have different preferences when it comes to replacing scratches, pumping up contrast, sharpening edges, cropping negative borders, etc.  Offering the basic image lets subsequent users make their own decisions about which features to change to suit a particular purpose or product.\n\nLack of money and time: If we had lots more resources, offering a 'cleaned up photo' in addition to the 'raw document' could be considered.  (Like pre-conservation and post-conservation images of a damaged and then repaired poster.) But our priority is basic digital access -- many more of the Library’s 14 million pictures should be available online first.","Well, this photo has one blatant black blotch which if removed would not bother anyone, I am sure.\n\nI am not asking you to edit sharpness, crops, borders, etc.  It is just cleaning up a piece of debris that I am sure no photographer would ever wish to have on his or her photo.

She carried a Congressional committee on a tour of North Africa in 1909, and the next year joined in a special South American cruise commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Buenos Aires, Argentina. As American interests in the Caribbean were threatened by internal political troubles in several nations Chester patroled off Mexico, Santa Domingo, and Haiti, and transported Marine occupation force in 1911.

Last Friday, we were given 48 Bain photos to puzzle out, but we could easily have handled a hundred. If LOC insists on dumping the other stuff onto Flickr, I suggest that they run three or four separate photostreams, so that they can keep the several feeds coming at a steady pace, while those of us who wish to do so can focus on the historically-fascinating Bain archive, and ignore the others.","Is there any information about the photographer?","This photograph of Vita at twenty-one may have been taken in 1913 for publicity purposes, when her engagement to Harold Nicolson was announced. They were wed on October 1, 1913, which surely was why Bain distributed copies of the photo to his clients at that time. At the time of her marriage, she was deeply, passionately in love -- with a young woman. As members of Britain's landed gentry, her family qualified as newsworthy. Harold Nicolson was a diplomat, posted to the British legation in Turkey, which was then the center of the Ottoman Empire.","Its also a shame that Google Goggles has been disabled for face searching to preserve privacy on the Internet.

Nowhere do the glades of Bronx Park look lovelier than from its commanding upper windows. With its sixty-eight rooms it is the chief attraction of this delightful natural playground. \n\nIt was erected about 1850 by Pierre Lorillard, and stands today as the home of the Bronx Society of Arts and Sciences, the large parlors being well filled with all sorts of objects, quaint and curious. \n\nThat portion of the extensive Lorillard domain west of the river boasts a splendid hemlock forest, declared to be without an equal anywhere. How fortunate that this family preserved so well the natural glories of their immense estate, so that in our day its magnificent trees and velvety lawns have been appropriately utilized as a Botanical Garden of 250 acres. \n\nBelow the mansion, winding driveways lead to the graceful old Lorillard stables, stone-built and solid, which resemble in their strikingly picturesque setting a chapel rather than a stable. To the south-west, across Pierre Lorillard's famous &quot;Acre of Roses,&quot; now the beautiful &quot;Old-fashioned Flower Garden,&quot; still rises high above the river's brim the substantial old Lorillard Snuff Mill, whose ancient wheels proved so wonderfully efficacious in producing the immense fortune of their owner.

Two months later, on August 26, in Atlanta, Leo Frank (in an infamous miscarriage of justice blamed on racial excitement and antisemitism) was found guilty, after trial, of the murder of a young factory employee, Mary Phagan. The verdict became national and international news. Frank's attorneys requested an appeal of the verdict, and excitement was running high in October and November, when Bain's news agency circulated this photo of the new governor's wife to its subscribers. Was this the only photo Bain could locate near to hand? Why Georgia's first lady, and not the Governor? \n\nAfter the appeals process, which continued through 1914 and part of 1915, Governor Slaton committed political suicide by commuting Frank's sentence from death by hanging to life imprisonment. But the Georgia mob would not have it; the KKK dragged Frank out of prison and lynched him. Only in 1986 did the state of Georgia grant him a posthumous pardon.","There was no more excitement about the murder of Mary Phagan, than there was over any other grizzly murder of a child in American history. The Leo Frank case became famous, because the organized Jewish community and many of its leaders decided to embrace the case as a cause celebre of anti-Semitism.  \n\nThere was NO miscarriage of Justice at the Leo Frank trial, because when Leo Frank mounted the witness stand on August 18, 1913, he made an admission that amounted to a murder trial confession. \n\nThe Leo Frank Admission that Amounted to a Murder Trial Confession:\n\nNow, gentlemen [of the jury], to the best of my recollection from the time the whistle blew for twelve o’clock [noon on Saturday, April 26, 1913] until after a quarter to one [12:46 pm] when I went up stairs and spoke to Arthur White and Harry Denham [on the fourth floor], to the best of my recollection, I did not stir out of the inner office [located at the front of the second floor]; but it is possible that in order to answer a call of nature or to urinate I may have gone to the toilet [in the metal room at the back of the second floor]. Those are things that a man does unconsciously and cannot tell how many times nor when he does it (Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence, August 18, 1913).","Seems to have been a North Carolina clubwoman.","She was engaged in social work on a large scale, as a district leader of both North and South Carolina.

The school opened that year on what had been the site of the National Conservatory of Music, which Dvorak directed briefly in the 1890's. Except for a brief period in the 1970's, when the concerts moved to Hunter College and Town Hall, Washington Irving has remained the series' principal home.

Kramer returned to Austria during the summer of 1914, and was apparently blocked from returning, because of the outbreak of World War 1.  He was replaced at New York Philharmonic Concertmaster by Maximilian Pilzer.  Leopold Kramer was Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for one season, 1922-1923.

Thanks and Greetings.","Most people do not know that Mr. Rickey started out as a catcher in 1906 with the Cleveland Browns.  He also played for the New York Highlanders the following year.  In this photo you have uploaded, he was the manager of the Browns. \n\nBranch Rickey had a lot of interesting ideas, among which was the &quot;farm system&quot; of minor league teams.  Most everyone in baseball respected him, called him &quot;Mr. Rickey&quot;, not &quot;Branch.&quot;  Not everyone got along with him.  He was a no nonsense person, a strict born again Christian type, never touched a drop of alcohol and never used foul language.  He knew how to get the most from his players and coaches and managers, for as little money as possible.  So, he was known as a penny pincher.  He had an uncanny knack of judging a young player's potential.  I have read some of his scouting notes, and he was uncanny in predicting the baseball futures of many ball players.\n\nMany people think that baseball would never have been integrated without Mr. Rickey, but that is not true.  Bill Veeck was working on getting Satchel Paige and Larry Doby for the Cleveland Indians around the same time.  The apparent hold up at that time, 1946, was Commissioner Happy Chandler who I think was a little skittish about allowing &quot;negroes&quot; into the major leagues, for whatever reason, perhaps having been pressured about it by various owners who knew that many white players were opposed to integration.  At any rate, it is fair to say that Mr. Rickey, The Dodger system, and Jackie Robinson, and the eventual cooperation of Commissioner Chandler, all were factors resulting in the signing of the first Black player in the modern era of the major leagues.\n\nI am fortunate to have known a man who worked in management in the Dodgers system for Mr. Rickey.  \n\nThis is a great photo, btw.  One usually sees photo of Mr. Rickey in his usual suit coat and bow tie.","Date on the photo (appears to be written on the back, as it's reversed) is 10/29/13 - so it appears this photo was taken in 1913, not 1910 - his first year as a manager.","I hate baseball love the modern artful sketchiness/painterliness of this","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1327251@N25/\">Catch The Male Portrait </a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","John Purroy Mitchel was elected (on a fusion ticket) to succeed Acting Mayor Ardolph Loges Kline.

After his death, his heirs ordered the hotel closed in September, 1913, then relented and granted it a reprieve, which is probably the news that triggered this photo.\n\nIn 1914 came another closing order; that too was reprieved. Then the kerfuffle in August, 1915. But the relief then was short lived. On November 10, 1915, the Fire Prevention Bureau shut the old vessel down for good, calling it a firetrap. [One reason was that all the doors opened inward.]\n\nFrom a website by a descendant of Stamler, who built the boat:\n\n&quot;Fortunately, the thirty-eight girls still living on the Stamler were found new homes on land. Arbuckle’s sisters 'had investigated all the other hotels and found them suitable,' according to the Times, 'and would pay the expenses of moving for each girl.' The vessel’s captain, cook, and other employees were promised new employment. The paper reported that 'many girls who used to live on the Stamler and have moved out because they got married or earned more money, came back for a last look at their old home, to laugh a little and cry a little with the girls who were leaving.'\n\n&quot;There are no extant records describing the Stamler’s ultimate fate. It’s rumored that she did ultimately burn in a fire, in 1916, at the foot of North Henry Street, but this is still unsubstantiated.&quot;","well it's good to see th protests came to something after all","A peek inside:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464318581/]\n\nThe tidy kitchen:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4526078318/in/photostream/]\n\nA floating dormitory:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4465082040/in/photostream/]\n\nAnother exterior view:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464303979/]","According to NYT of October 2, 1913, \n  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EED7163DE633A25751C0A9669D946296D6CF&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=ritchie+o'neill&amp;st=p\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EED7163DE633A...</a>\nSapper O'Neill and Young Fox were British boxers and George McDonald their manager.

A tongue-in-cheek photo feature in the Perrysburg Journal (Ohio), published June 14, 1917, tells his story: “German ‘Traitor’ Dog is Vernon Castle’s War Prize.” \n\n“Vernon Castle’s ‘German traitor’ dog has been the object of keen admiration among friends of the actor since his return to America from the battlefields of France, where he has been doing service with the British Flying Corps.  The dog is of the breed used by the Huns for police work and also for Red Cross scout duty.  It was originally in the German army, but, being, an especially intelligent animal and vigorously opposed to murderous Kaiserism, it boldly deserted to the English forces in the thick of battle.  Now the dog is thoroughly British, so much so that he dotes on making mincemeat of any dachshund he can find.  The picture is the first which Mrs. Vernon Castle has had taken with her husband since he came home.”\n\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87076843/1917-06-14/ed-1/seq-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87076843/1917-06-14/ed-...</a>","Marv, that's a wonderful story, thanks. Incidentally Susan Orlean (author of &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;) has a new book out, about Rin Tin Tin, the original dog star of the movies, who was discovered as a German Shepherd pup in a nest of newborn puppies in the middle of a WWI battlefield, surrounded by the disasters of war. Susan was interviewed this morning (9/24/2011) on NPR.","Thanks, Wystan.  I read the review of Susan Orlean's Rin Tin Tin book in the New Yorker a few weeks ago.  His master's divorce from a woman who just couldn't compete with him for her husband's affection put me in mind of the joke: &quot;I got a dog for my husband. It was a really good trade!&quot;\n\nAt present, I'm immersed to my eyeballs in early 20th century show business history, in hot pursuit of something called &quot;the collie ballet,&quot; in which the father of my first wife appeared in 1910 (she died in 1991, and her father, Walter Burke, died in 1966, too soon for me to have met him).  Both the ballet and Mr. Burke were minor features of a smashingly successful musical called &quot;The Top o' th' World,&quot; which launched him on a thirty-year theater and vaudeville career.  The wonderful Dolly Sisters' routine, &quot;The Dollys and their collies,&quot; was a pale imitation of this act presented many years later.  Walter also happened to be a WWI pilot who was in training in Texas at the same time, or just after, Vernon Castle crashed and died there on a training flight in 1918.","If the January, 1914 on the negative is correct, though, the story of the &quot;German Traitor Dog&quot;  would seem to be made up by the press or Vernon C's management, since war didn't break out until August, 1914.\nIt's possible that Irene is holding her pet monkey in her right hand, as she is in this other Bain photo:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7949420400/\" title=\"Mrs. Vernon Castle (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8454/7949420400_18b3cc067c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Mrs. Vernon Castle (LOC)\" /></a>","I think I figured this out.

As the story goes, when Finn got to Scotland and seen the enormous size of the Caledonian Giant he quickly ran back to the Antrim coast to hide.  The Scottish Giant then came looking for Finn - who in an attempt to hide dressed himself as a baby and hid in a big basket, and asked Finn's wife where he was - she told him Finn was out hunting but would be back soon.  The Giant then noticed the baby and fear came over him - if that was the size of Finn's baby then how much bigger must Finn himself be??? He then made a quick escape, in case Finn was to return, and ran home to Scotland destroying the path behind him as he went.\n\nFunnily the causeway was also used as the backdrop to the final parts of Hellboy 2!","@Shikari - they're basalt columns, formed when the liquid basalt rock hardened under unusual conditions.

The prints look deceptively like color photographs unless viewed with a magnifying glass.&quot;  Hope this helps.","Ryan: thanks this does help :)","Terrific sense of scale!","This is a gorgeous and thrilling set of photographs, but to clarify the title of this one: these are actually called The Cliffs Of Moher, in County Clare.","The Cliffs haven't changed in a hundred years - nice spot for a table and chairs to have a drink ( I think that's gone now ! )","LOC -- the original caption on the photo reads &quot;Clare&quot; -- not &quot;Claire.&quot; So why even mention the incorrect spelling in the LOC title?","The Cliffs of Insanity!","Wystan -- Good question.  We had a choice back in 2000 when we first worked with the Photochrom Collection -- use the caption printed on the picture, or, the title listed in the 1905 Detroit Publishing Company sales catalog. We went with the sales catalog because it had helpful additional information like country names.  \n\nAs misspellings or out-of-date names are spotted, we weave the correctly spelled or current names into the titles, prefaced with &quot;i.e.&quot;  The published spelling  has been left in the titles to help people working from the old sales catalog find the corresponding images. But, we're beginning to experiment with parking these 'misspellings' and incorrectly identified places in the notes area.\n\nAnd, Increasingly with new projects, we rely on the captions as they appear in the original images, no matter how incomplete. The spirit of &quot;transcription&quot; helps us represent the images as their creators presented them.  Transcription can also make it easier to retrieve and compare copies of an image in different collections, or to share catalog records among libraries.  Like book cataloging.\n\nUnlike books, though, even transcribed photo titles are still likely to have misspellings and bracketed corrections. We've come full circle.","Un air irlandais (reel) est joué sur le titre de &quot;Cliffs of Moher&quot;.","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1386970@N23/\">Fotos PRECIOSAS.</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","nearly the same view... taken on April 26, 2008\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/42687077@N08/3956217705/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2552/3956217705_94e6227767.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"The Cliffs of Moher\" /></a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/998794@N25/\">Fans of Cliffs of Moher</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\nWE MADE IT!

These included Annie Moore and her two brothers – the first immigrants to be processed on Ellis Island in New York. On 11 April 1912 Queenstown was the final port of call for the RMS Titanic as she set out across the Atlantic on her ill-fated maiden voyage. The RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat off the Old Head of Kinsale on May 7, 1915. The survivors were brought to the town of Cobh, and over one hundred victims lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery about a mile north of the town. \n\nThe chilling last words of 19-year-old Jeremiah Burke from Glanmire, Co. Cork, were slipped into a bottle not read until a year after his death on the Titanic. Now, the emotional artifact is on display at Cobh Heritage Centre.

The site of the cathedral has been a place of worship since the 7th century. The three spires of the cathedral are one of Cork's main landmarks. It is the seat of the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, currently Bishop Paul Colton. It is named after Cork's patron saint.\n\nA Medieval Cathedral was situated on the site prior to the 18th Century building, but few traces of it are visible. The cathedral was damaged during the siege of Cork in 1689/90, when it came under fire from the nearby Elizabeth Fort. When the steeple was demolished in 1865, a 24-pound cannon was discovered, which is now on display in the cathedral.\n\nA small Neo-Classical building was constructed on the site in 1735 by Bishop Peter Browne. It was demolished in 1865 to make way for the present cathedral. The 1735 entrance gate survived the re-building and is still in use.\n\nArchitect William Burges began work on the present Gothic Revival cathedral in 1862. Construction started on the cathedral in 1865 and in 1870 the unfinished building was consecrated. The towers and spires were finally completed in 1879.\n\nBurges gifted a Resurrection Angel, made of copper and gold leaf, which is located on the pinnacle of the sanctuary roof. There is a local superstition which states that if ever the angel falls, it would signify the end of the world.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mickdunne101/4746188267/\">www.flickr.com/photos/mickdunne101/4746188267/</a>","<b>Gesehen</b> in: <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2373102807_bb01b2908d.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"155\" alt=\"\" /> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1439200@N23/\"> <b>Kirchen, Klöster und Kapellen (K-K-K)\nJust great!</b></a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/66555094@N00/\">Donegal  Tír Chonaill places,people and friends.</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\nlovely old shot","Thank you so much for posting these old photographs of Donegal.

In a remarkable display of spine the city fathers refused planning permission for a hideous structure in one of the most complete Georgian Squares in Western Europe.

Apalling damage was done to the street as a result of the Rising of 1916 when a gunboat sailed up the Liffey to the Bridge and fired on the street.  The street was restored afterwards and today looks, if anything, more impressive.  Film of the Rising in 1916 shows new trees having been planted in the centre of the street and these were all removed in the past decade as the architects' department of Dublin City Council decided to 'improve' the street and rebrand it as a boulevard in the French style.  Dubliners were horrified at the loss of the mature London Plane trees which had housed a massive population of wagtails and other birds.

The street curves to the left to go towards O'Connell Bridge over the river Liffey and Oconnell Street, formerly Sackville.

Following independence the statue was removed from the street and is usually in storage.  I saw it recently and the impact of many attacks is clearly visible as are the various attempts to restore the work.  Nowadays a charming 1960s fountain of the Four Provinces sits on this site.  As Glamborghini notes the facade dominating the view is that of the University of Dublin, Trinity College.  Trinity or TCD is the second largest and the oldest university in Ireland.  It ranks in the top 50 worldwide and has a venerable history that includes Oscar Wilde, Oliver Goldsmith, Dean Swift, Douglas Hyde, Mary Robinson and Samuel Beckett.  The college prides itself on being unorthodox and a place where not being part of the crowd is seen as an asset.  In recent years the college has expanded and grown and a greater focus on pulling in international students and talent as well as world class research has dominated.  Also the university has opened up it's Old Library to visitors so they can see many of the greatest Irish treasures including a Proclamation of the Republic and the greatest treasure of the Celts, the Book of Kells.  Not to be missed either is the Douglas Hyde Gallery, named for Ireland's first president and an institution for cutting edge art.  If you ever get to Dublin try and get a student to show you round the college.","Glamborghini :\n\nThanks for the additional information about this photograph.

Apparently the last horse-drawn tram ran in 1901 and the first electric tram was in 1896.  This picture shows no sign of lines for electric trams.  Also, the other photo shows a style of electric lamp outside Trinity College that was apparently used between 1892 and 1903.

The Royal Irish Academy, a cross-border institution, and the oldest research body in Ireland decided after much discussion to call the city, Derry and the county, Londonderry.  Politicians and locals all split in different ways.  Originally designated Doire na Calgach in the 6-7th centuries the city over time became Doire and further Anglicized to Derry.  Doire being Irish for oakwood.  With the plantation of the area by merchants from London in the 16th and 17th Centuries the name became Londonderry and so the battles began as to what to call the place.  The local radio station in an effort to reduce tensions calls this provincial town, Stroke City.","Thank you doctorbob, for the additional information.  We may just leave it as is for now, and see how others respond.","I seem to recall reading on a tourist information poster in Guild Hall Square, it says the name of the city became &quot;Londonderry&quot; after &quot;The London Company&quot; built the city walls.","The name was changed on the 29th June 1613","This image desires my viewing.

On board are Mrs. John Lind, wife of President Wilson's envoy to Mexico, many other American passengers, and mail for the United States. \n\nCaptain Huff, the vessels' commander has been cited to appear tomorrow before a local judge to answer a criminal charge. What the charge is has not been told, and the Mexican authorities have not disclosed its nature.\n\nMr. Lind, who saw his wife go on board the Morro Castle, has sent a vigorous cablegram of protest to Secretary of State Bryan, and to Minister of Foreign Affairs Mojano in Mexico City.\n\nThe Morro Castle has been preparing to steam for two days. It was announced last night that Mrs. Lind would be among the passengers. All passengers were aboard this morning and the vessel was in shape to clear when word was sent out to the vessel that clearance papers had been returned by officers of the port. The pilot was warned not to go aboard.\n\nCaptain Huff, with local representatives of the line, immediately took steps to learn the cause of the holding up of the vessel, and then Captain Huff was served with the citation. \n\nWhile these things were taking place ashore, the Mexican gunboat Zaragosa steamed from her anchorage in the shadow of the Island Fortress and took its position just off the bow of the Morro Castle. \n\n(October 23, 1913)\n\n\nUS AND MEXICO SITUATION OMINOUS \n\nPresident Expected To Issue Ultimatum Warning Foreign Warship to Keep Away. \nDevelopments at a few hours today in the relations between the United Stares and Mexico emphasized a gravity of affairs more ominous than at any time since President Wilson's administration began.

The marriage ceremony which was witnessed only by a few friends and relatives of the couple, was followed by a reception at Sunridge Hall, the country residence of the bride’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Steele. A special train from New York carried many guests to the reception and the hunting set of Long Island was well represented. The news of the engagement in June came as a surprise, as few outside of the immediate families of the young couple knew that a deeper sentiment than a mutual interest in sports existed between them.

He was graduated from Oxford in 1903 and from Harvard in 1906. He was star of the American polo team in England in 1909 and again in 1910 and distinguished himself in the last international series.

They did throw the ball in the backfield, mostly laterals.  The ball back then was a bit rounder and harder to pass compared to the modern day ball.  Football was more a running game, more like rugby.  I wish there were more old movies to watch of football.  Most of the films I have seen are very brief and from a distance.

Under the Second Empire (1852-1870), however, Dieppe was abandoned by the jet-set, and Trouville, located in a less windy environment, was elected &quot;Queen of the Beaches&quot;. In fact, the local development of Trouville started in the 1830s, when the English fad of sea bathing was imported to Normandy. The oldest advertisement for Trouville dates back to 1837, in the local newspaper Le Pays d'Auge. Sea bathing was strictly regulated by a municipal decree in 1857: the beach was divided into three sectors, those for women's and men's bathing being separated by a mixed sector. The swimmers had to change their clothes in beach huts provided by the municipality, whereas rich people had &quot;bathing machines&quot; on casters. The railway station of Trouville-Deauville was inaugurated in 1863; the journey from Paris to Trouville-Deauville lasted 5 hours. In 1868, a center for hydrotherapy was built in the gardens of the city hall. Deauville, built from scratch in 1859 by duke of Morny, Napoléon's III half-brother, attracted several of the posh customers of Trouville.\nThe concurrence of Deauville, however, did not alter too much the fame of Trouville. In 1906, the tourist guide Joane mentioned &quot;big horse races, international regattas, polo, clay pigeon shooting and the Eden-concert theater&quot; in Trouville. The Hôtel de Paris had for regular customers the famous actresses Sarah Bernhardt (1844-1923) and Réjane (1856-1920) and the artistic jet-set of Paris.&quot;","Thanks so much for the image and the information!","Industrialist Charles Michael Schwab","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/20595373@N00/\">Face Time</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michael_Schwab\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michael_Schwab</a>","Could someone explain to me why this photo feels so &quot;modern&quot;  and not  a hundred years old like many other portraits in this photostream?","Date written on negative is 9/23/13.

She died five years later in an automoblie accident leaving Harrison to raise two small daughters. Harrison would marry and divorce five more times to: Mabel Judson Cox, Elizabeth Wrentmore, Margaret Wrentmore and Doria Lee. Maria Teresa, a young Filipino woman, outlived Harrison.\nOne of Harrison's daughters by his first marriage was Barbara Harrison Wescott (1904-1977). While living in France, she worked closely with other American expatriates in the literary world. She and Monroe Wheeler established Harrison of Paris, a press publishing limited-edition literary paperbacks. From 1930 to 1934, Harrison of Paris published thirteen titles, including two new works by Glenway Wescott, Wheeler's longtime companion. In 1934, shortly before Barbara Harrison married Glenway's brother Lloyd Wescott, the press relocated to New York, where it published a final title, Katherine Anne Porter's Hacienda. She continued her patronage of the arts throughout her life and was a noted collector of artwork.\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Burton_Harrison\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Burton_Harrison</a>","THIS IS NOT Mrs. Francis Burton Harrison (Mary Crocker).

Since this photograph is dated May 1, 1914, it is more likely that this is Mr. Harrison's second wife, Mabel Judson Cox.  (It's important to note that some of the dates on Bain photographs are later than the actual day the photo was taken, but it seems rather unlikely that they would have acquired a photograph of the first Mrs. Harrison nine years after her death in 1905.) He married Cox in 1907 and they divorced in 1919.  I was not able turn up a photograph identified as Mabel Judson Cox for comparison.\n\nBarbara Harrison ( Wescott)  would have been around ten years old at the time of this photograph.  The second Mrs. Harrison did have a son by her first husband, and there was a younger Harrison daughter, Virginia, so it's pretty difficult to be sure of the identity of the children here.  \n\nIf there had not been a total of six Mrs. F.

Etymologically, it derives from the Greek phrase &quot;εἰς τὴν Πόλιν&quot; [is tin ˈpolin] or in the Aegean dialect &quot;εἰς τὰν Πόλιν&quot; [is tan ˈpolin] (modern Greek &quot;στην Πόλη&quot; [stin ˈpoli]), which means &quot;in the city&quot;, &quot;to the city&quot; or &quot;downtown&quot;.[5] To this day, Greeks often refer to Istanbul as 'tin Poli' (the City).[citation needed] A version found in Western languages, Stamboul, was used in lieu of Istanbul until the creation of the modern Turkish language by Atatürk after 1932. Before that time, English-speaking sources used Stamboul to describe the central parts on the historic peninsula between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara.[6]\n\nIn modern Turkish the name is written &quot;İstanbul&quot; with a dotted İ; in the Turkish alphabet dotted i (with capital İ) is a different letter from dotless ı (with capital I). Also, while in English the stress is on the first syllable (&quot;Is&quot;), in Turkish it is on the second syllable (&quot;tan&quot;).","WOW..

The only difference is there is a dock built and the Mexican flag on the one building.  So my question, because I am curious, is WHY is there a Mexican Flag there?  The only consulate I can find is in Paris, not Nice.  Did it by any chance move to Nice at some point?","That isn't a Mexican flag. Go to the persistent URL in the description, click through the image, and examine the high resolution TIF file. (It's 29mb, the detail is there.) There's no eagle in the center. Color of photocroms is influenced by the process of the technician who created it. In the close up detail of the flag, you can even see some color separation, similar to what you would see in a 3D image, and at the very edges of the left of the tricolor, is blue, and some greenish yellow superimposed over it. This is a French flag.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevincollins/4217853642/]","Cool!  Didn't know that about the photocroms.  Learn something new everyday and maybe this will end the &quot;dispute&quot; of whether this is Nice or not LOL.  Also found out that it couldn't have been an Italian flag as it's current flag design didn't come about until 1946 (just a side note to answer some who thought it was an Italian flag).","The pier no longer exists, but this is almost certainly taken from about 10-yards west of the the point at which Promenade des Anglais (now tripartite) meets Quai des Etats-Unis.\n\nSee the Statue in this version: <a href=\"http://www.corbisimages.com:80/Enlargement/Enlargement.aspx?id=42-18376507&amp;ext=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.corbisimages.com:80/Enlargement/Enlargement.aspx?id=4...</a>\n\nAnd compare to Google Maps view of the same statue (it's not far from the Hotel Meridian, on the pedestrianised circle) - also look West to match the slope of the land mass into the sea.\n\nMy guess for the closest address for where the photo was probably taken from would be about 109 Quia des Etats-Unis, 06300, Nice France","It's the beach at the bottom of the Promonade des Anglais.

Then read Kevin's post concerning the flag and the type of photography.  It is the French flag, just the type of photography make the colors wrong.","It seems many folk commenting here can't or won't read previous comments\nAs <img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/buddyicons/21222453@N05.jpg?1249075005#21222453@N05\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" />  points out, the flag is French, and, as others and myself have pointed out, there is no doubt this is Nice.\nTry reading comments before posting.","If it is not Nice, it may be Frejus seen from St-Raphael ; there is an old bridge there like the one pictured.

I first thought of the Negresco hotel (in Nice) but it has a dome on its front side. But the hotel was built in 1912...\n\nWhat still makes me doubt it is Nice (or Frejus) is the stone construction;  why would they had to remove it?","Couple potential answers to Alex HHHH2o's question on the stone construction and why it seems to be gone.  I don't know what is there now, but if it IS gone completely.....3 potential things could have happened - destruction during World War 2 when the Italians occupied Nice OR destruction during the tsunami in 1979.  Just looking at the history of Nice to see if there was anything to account for it.  Else, could have been a bad design and therefore had to be taken down OR just general expansion and the need to reconstruct the area.","As others have pointed out, it looks like Nice.

It is hard to tell if the roof was raised, or if that's an illusion created by the angle of the photos, but if that did happen, perhaps it was to create room for the upgraded mechanical systems.

The links that show modern day St. Moritz have the hotel buildings closer, or &quot;in front&quot; of the tower.  Even if the image is flipped, it wouldn't account for that discrepency.

One person looks like there is a reflection there and it looks like the snow is pushed back and there is a path from the &quot;road&quot; to the ice.  Does St. Mortiz fit this?  Just curious.

However, the number of people who die from drinking related illness is nowhere near the hundreds of thousands who die from smoking related illnesses.  Smoking is the number one cause of death in the United States besides normal aging, thus it is the number one preventable cause of death.  One in five deaths is due to smoking according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nSmoking does not harm just the self.  It is well documented that second hand smoke indeed is a major health hazard.","The Joel family were Jewish South African diamond/gold tycoons. I believe J.B.

He was ordained in Germany in 1904, arrived in the United States in 1908 and was assigned to St. John's Parish in Louisville, Kentucky. Arguments with the minister resulted in Schmidt's transfer to St. Boniface Church in New York City. There he met beautiful Anna Aumuller, a housekeeper for the rectory who had recently emigrated from Austria. Despite his transfer to a church far uptown, Father Schmidt and Anna continued a romantic affair and, in a secret ceremony he performed himself, they were married. When he discovered she was pregnant, Father Schmidt knew his secret life would soon be exposed. On the night of September 2, 1913, he cut Anna's throat, dismembered her body, and threw the parts into the Hudson River. When the body was discovered, he was arrested and charged with the murder. A media circus ensued, as the New York papers became fascinated by the priest and his double life. After feigning insanity during his first trial, which ended with a hung jury, Father Schmidt was eventually convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. He remains the only priest ever executed for murder in the United States","<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Schmidt_(priest)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Schmidt_(priest)</a>\n\nWiki could use this photo.","quite a story","Another Bain/LOC photo of the murderer of Anna Aumueller, Father Hans B.

Frölich was educated by a tutor and then was a sailor until 1890 when he immigrated to New York. After working as a model for Daniel Chester French, he became his protégé. His art studies were continued at the ASL in NYC and in Paris at Ecole Nationale and Ecole des Beaux Arts. Coming from New York, he worked in Seattle where he was director of sculpture at Alaska-Yukon Expo of 1909 and continued in this capacity for the PPIE in San Francisco. During the WWI years he was an instructor at UC Berkeley and director of the Oakland Art Gallery. By 1921 he had moved to southern California where he was active as a sculptor for the movie industry. He ran Frölich's School of Sculpture in Hollywood from 1924-44 and spent his last three years as an instructor at the Carmel Art Institute. Frölich died in Carmel, CA on Sept. 5, 1947.

The fierce Sioux tribe which - nearly half a century ago, massacred General Custer and his brave band of cavalrymen in the valley of the Little Big Horn, has changed into a peaceful community of farmers. And Uncle Sam is about to add the finishing touch to their new civilization. \n\nThere are but 3,000 left of the nomadic Sioux bands that long terrified the Northwest. In recent years they have been confined on the Fort Peck reservation, in northern Montana, far from the scene of their last big battle, where they mustered 20,000 or more.\n\nHere, as the wards of the government, they have had the limited freedom of 2,068,000 acres —one square mile for eaoh redskin. But now their range is to be further restricted to make room for the invading hordes of white settlers, hungry for land. The Indians have been allotted 723,693 acres, making farms averaging 240 acres apiece, and the remaining 1,345,000 acres have been carved into 8,406 white man's farms to be drawn by lot, beginning September 1.\n\nPicture with caption: &quot;Horse's Ghost, with part of his prize-winning exhibit at the Indian fair. Above, Tiger Horse, old Sioux who fought against Custer. Below, Old Buffalo Grass, another enemy of Custer's, now a Christian.&quot;\n\nThe Indians are prepared for the change. That is the remarkable phase of this business. They themselves have made easy the last transition stage from barbarism to agricultural competition with their paleface enemies.\n\n                   Two years ago Louis Hill, chairman of the board of directors of the Great Northern railroad, picked a few Indians from the reservation and sent them to the New York land show. He wanted them to see what the white man was doing with land like theirs. Chief Crazy Bull was one of them.\n\nThey saw and were converted. When Crazy Bull and his braves returned they preached farming, and began to practice it, too.  It takes scientific methods to raise good crops in this semi-arid land, where the soil Is fertile, but rainfall is a gamble. Fields are usually allowed to &quot;lie fallow&quot; every other year, and the farmer must plow deep, treasure every bit of moisture and use wisdom in selecting and rotating crops. Wise cultivation, however, brings big rewards. What those amateur Indian farmers did was shown last October at Poplar, Mont., in the first &quot;Indian fair&quot; ever held. Crazy Bull and some of the Indian school boys and girls made especially good  records. They produced 20 to 25 bushels of wheat to the acre,-60 to 85 bushels of oats and 18 to 26 bushels of flax.  This year they have twice as much land under cultivation, and the average production is running just as high.&quot;","From the proximity to the last picture of Horse's Ghost at the Poplar, Montana (Fort Peck Indian Reservation)August,1912 fair, this is likely also from near Poplar.  Flax farming was a program being promoted on the reservation by the U.S. government to turn the residents into farmers.","The Tlalpan Cadets were the personal guard of Mexican President Huerta.","<a href=\"http://www.glittergraphicsnow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll149/glittergn/christmas/christmas new/1229951869_be5a4e5cab90b5f189cdb926.gif\" alt=\"MySpace and Orkut Christmas Glitter Graphic\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.glittergraphicsnow.com/christmas/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christmas Glitter</a>\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!\n\nWell done, Keep up the good work!","In the Getty Research Institute Digital Collections there's a photo entitled Arcos de Belén, Aspirantes (cadets) de Tlalpan.\n<a href=\"http://archives.getty.edu/R/EX9QIQGC4X2NJ2L4HKVSBKN47HUUMG3NRENDF448BBVYJIFC6P-04688?func=results-jump-full&amp;set_entry=000020&amp;set_number=000388&amp;base=GEN01-GRI01\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.getty.edu/R/EX9QIQGC4X2NJ2L4HKVSBKN47HUUMG3NREND...</a>\ntaken most likely during the Decena Trágica (Ten Tragic Days), between February 9 to 18, 1913.\nThe cadets seem to wear the same uniforms, so both pictures could be a part of a series.\nAnd if they were Huerta's personal guard, they were approaching National Palace when President Madero was already arrested or murdered on February 22nd?

Across Arcos de Belen heading south, the street takes the name General G. Hernández up to Dr. Río de la Loza, where Cárcel de Belem (Belem Prison) was located (today there is found PGJ building [Procuraduría General de Justicia]).  It was most likely taken in February 1913, during the 10 Tragic Days (Decena Trágica) when both buildings were warded by federals.  Quite near was the Ciudadela (Fire arms mill), which was sieged and heavy combats took place. Although trees on background make believe they are close (two or three blocks) to La Alameda.

The heavy favorites were English legends Harry Vardon (1900 U.S. Open winner; four-time British Open winner) and Ted Ray (reigning British Open champion). After 72 holes, the pair found themselves tied with 20-year-old amateur Francis Ouimet—who had grown up across the street from the course and was a former caddie at the club—forcing an 18-hole playoff the next day. In a shocking upset, Ouimet soundly defeated the two professional golfers in front of a large gallery, and the resulting newspaper stories captured the imagination of the American public. The number of golfers in the country at least tripled in the subsequent ten years, with a corresponding increase in golf courses (including many public courses, opening up the game to a larger segment of the population). &quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Country_Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Country_Club</a>","See <a href=\"http://www.golfandcountryclubart.com/countryclubs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.golfandcountryclubart.com/countryclubs.htm</a> for  a modern watercolor of the building.","Here are some photographs of the modern day clubhouse:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.tcclub.org/club/scripts/ImageAlbum/view_albums.asp?GRP=6580&amp;NS=PUBLIC&amp;SRC=&amp;AID=6024&amp;page=2#\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.tcclub.org/club/scripts/ImageAlbum/view_albums.asp?GR...</a>","That looks like a bad lie...

Mayor George B. McClellan Jr., a candidate for reelection, holds the tiger's leash but cannot control the behavior of the Tammany beast.  The young, 39-year-old mayor appears as a boy sitting, like Humpty Dumpty, atop a wall; in this case, one that protects the &quot;Gardens of Murfiz&quot; (named for Tammany boss Charles F. Murphy), where illicit money grows on trees.  \n\nThe one who has escaped the tiger's path of destruction is William Travers Jerome, the New York district attorney (1901-1909) who continually waged war against the corruption of Tammany Hall and the city government.  Here, Jerome stands priming his firearm to shoot the unsuspecting tiger.  McClellan won a second term a few weeks after this cartoon was published, and soon broke completely with Tammany Hall.

One component of the event was a competition for the newly developed motorized pumper.  On September 3 at 6:30 a.m., the 12-hour pump test began with 11 pieces of apparatus competing.  A  length of hard suction hose was used by each engine to draft water from the Hudson River.  \n\nOverall performance of the equipment was determined by using a point system.  The motor had to remaining running during the complete 12-hour test period.\n\nApparatus from the following companies began the event.\n\nAhrens-Fox\nAmerican LaFrance - Two units\nKnox\nLuietweiler\nNott - Two units  \nRobinson - Two units\nSeagrave\nWaterous\n\nEight of the engines completed the test.  The Luietweiler, one Nott and one Robinson failed.
