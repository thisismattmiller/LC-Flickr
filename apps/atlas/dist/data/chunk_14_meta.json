It seems that the Griffith Family, who owned the Washington Senators, had tried for years to get the nation's chief executive to the ballpark. This would almost certainly guarantee a big attendance gate in DC, and generate positive newspaper headlines. Presidents prior to this, such as Grover Cleveland (from Buffalo, New York), were concerned attending a baseball game would convey the wrong message to the public about presidential dilagence.\n  By the time of President Taft's tenure, this attitude had changed, and our Presidents were able to relax a bit. President Taft, who was from the Cincinnati area, was an avid golfer as well as a baseball fan. He attended a 1909 game, as a spectator only, with his Vice-President James Sherman (from Utica, New York). Opening Day 1910, had to be something of a relief for President Taft, as his duties earlier in the day had him attending a Woman Suffrage gathering, where he was hissed and booed for the views he expressed. This makes me think Big Bill was ready to get to the ballpark.\n  The Presidential party for the 1910 'opener' consisted of President and Mrs. Taft, Vice-President Sherman, Secretary of State Charles Baker and Major Archibald Butt, a military aid to the President. The idea of the President actually 'tossing' a ball to the players on the field, may have been hatched on the spot by the Senator's manager Jimmy McAleer, who tried to coax his camera shy star pitcher, Walter Johnson, into to receiving the throw. Walter Johnson begged off the official program, in favor of Senator's catcher Gabby Street. Players from both the Washington Senators and visiting Philadelphia A's gathered near the Executive Box. However, the Taft Administration adeptly interpreted developments in the park, and the President rather than throwing the ball to Gabby Street as planned, directed his throw to the starting pitcher Walter Johnson, who made a shoe top catch. With that throw, a new baseball and presidential tradition, had begun.\n  The game was a good one for the Senators, as they defeated the Athletics 3-0, getting their new season off on the right foot. Walter Johnson held the A's hitless until the 7th, and their only hit resulted from a collision between the Senator's right fielder and a fan. The 'Big Train' had to settle for a one-hit, shut-out victory (Bob Feller in 1940 pitched the only opening day no-hitter). The game at Griffith Stadium did have one frightening moment, when a line-drive foul off the bat of the Athletics' 'Home-Run' Baker, pegged Secretary of State Bennett in the head. The danger that looms at every ballgame, was quickly shaken-off by Secretary Bennett, but I'll bet the Griffith family gave the batting screen a new look. President Taft was on hand again to open the 1911 baseball season in Washington, with his military adjunct Major Butt, in this new a well received roll of delivering the first pitch.\n  President Taft was a member of the Republican Party. He was the hand picked successor to President Theodore Roosevelt (from Oyster Bay, New York), and was elected in 1908. Major Archie Butt was a Spanish-American War veteran, who served in both the Philippines and Cuba. The Spanish-American War was similar to our present entanglements, in that a struggle persisted for years against entrenched insurgents. President Roosevelt, during his tenure in the White House relied on the opinions of Major Butt, and the two men became good friends. When President Taft succeeded President Roosevelt, he retained Major Butt in the same official capacity, and these two men also became good friends. President Taft's administration was beset by a number of problems that lead him to disagreements with former President Roosevelt. By the next election year, 1912, these disagreements had become so profound that Theodore Roosevelt decided to split from the Republican Party, and to campaign for the White House once more as the Progressive Party candidate (nicknamed the Bull Moose Party due to Roosevelt presence). This rift created deep anxiety for Major Butt, as he would need to decide which of his two friends to support. In order to make up his mind, he took a six week sabbatical to Europe before the 1912 campaign began in earnest. He was scheduled to be back in Washington by mid April, and would have in all likelihood, opened another baseball season with President Taft at Griffith Stadium. However, Major Butt booked his return passage aboard the RMS Titanic, and lost his life at sea when that vessel sank. Due to the Titanic disaster, President Taft did not attend the 1912 baseball opening day, and asked Vice-President Sherman to attend instead, being the first time a VP threw out the first pitch.\n  Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected President in 1912, over incumbent President Taft, and former President Roosevelt. In what seems to be a strange bit of irony, Vice President Sherman died only days before the 1912 election being one of seven Vice-Presidents to die while serving office. President Wilson continued the tradition of the Presidential first pitch, as have all succeeding Presidents except for Jimmy Carter (there was no major league baseball in Washington, DC during President Carter's administration).

Even though Mrs. Roger Sullivan has made these comments, I think she might have played a bigger role than she may have thought. I would imagine that as a wife she would have had to throw dinners and attend important events. She must have had to keep a certain reputation or else risk her husband's political standing.

Here's some more press on her (her comments posted above were when she accompanied her husband with their 5 children and guests to the 1908 Nat'l Dem Conv. in Denver):  From Belleville News Democrat 1914.10.21 - Roger Charles Sullivan “was the first practical sociologist of his time, sort of a crude Hull House on legs.” ** “No sketch of Sullivan would be complete that did not include a reference to his family life.

I suspect that all the people here who condemn him are either A) from the South and don't like the fact that he ordered their boy Jeff Davis chained to a wall in his cell, B) hypocrites who live in the Western States only because Nelson Miles and his army made the west safe for settlers, or C) ignorant people who don't know that he repeatedly called for fair and humane treatment of the &quot;Native Americans&quot; before Congress, and made many political enemies because of this principled stance.\n\nP.S. The term &quot;Native Americans&quot; is not an accurate description. At the time that term was coined we thought the &quot;Native Americans&quot; were native to the Western Hemisphere. We know now that this is not true, they were simply the first immigrants to the Western Hemisphere, having immigrated from Mongolia long before the &quot;whites&quot; immigrated from Europe. They are just immigrants to this land like the &quot;whites&quot; are. Just because they were first does not entitle them to any special privileges, just like the &quot;whites&quot; do not afford the Italians any special privileges in North America because Columbus was the first among them to arrive.","The &quot;Native Americans&quot; indeed immigrated to North America, 13-15,000 years ago and were the first known humans here.  They had long established tribes and lands that they inhabited which were unfairly taken away from them by Europeans who had absolutely no right to do so, but the whites had the might of gunpowder and also diseases such as small pox which they spread among the tribes.  I disagree with you.  The &quot;Native Americans&quot; indeed were entitled to lands they settled on because they were here before the white Europeans.  They were here for thousands of years.  They were treated miserably and their treatment was  often worse than the treatment the white Europeans gave to the black slaves of the south.   I don't care if Miles did call for fair and humane treatment of them.  It was not fair and humane to drive them from their land or to take them into custody, and certainly not to kill them if they did not give in.  His idea of &quot;fair and humane treatment&quot; was not my idea of fair and humane.   Face it, our European forefathers were nothing but avaricious bullies who felt they had a right to eradicate an entire race of people simply because they, the whites, felt intellectually and morally superior.  To them, the &quot;Native Americans&quot; were noble savages.  The white man had &quot;God&quot; on his side.  And that is another thing, it was wrong to force Christianity on these people.  They already had a &quot; natural religion of the Great Spirit&quot; and an established culture.   You can argue all you want that one religion is better than another or that one culture is more advanced than another, but don't try to peddle this &quot;fair and humane&quot; genocide of a race of human beings.","You say:&quot;The &quot;Native Americans&quot; indeed were entitled to lands they settled on because they were here before the white Europeans.&quot; If you were intellectually honest, you would therefore also argue for an end to all immigration to the United States because the land belongs to those who are already here and nobody else has a right to come and live on this land.\n\n\nWhy should North America belong to the Asian-Americans (Mongolian immigrants now called Native Americans) only? Why cannot Europeans, Africans, and other Asians also immigrate and live here? \n\nThe United States did not acquire any of it's land from &quot;Native Americans&quot;, with the possible exception of Hawaii. All U.S. land was acquired from Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, and Russia. If the so-called &quot;Naive-Americans&quot; have any beef it should be with these colonial powers and not the U.S. which acquired it's land though international treaties with said colonial powers.\n\nYes, some &quot;whites&quot; treated some of their &quot;non-white&quot; American countrymen unjustly, but that can be attributed to their being human not to their being &quot;white&quot;. All humans have a cruel and mean streak, it is part of our descent from animals. How many countless atrocities were committed by the &quot;Native Americans&quot; against &quot;whites&quot;?","Read &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; by Dee Brown and also try &quot;My Apologies to the Iroquois&quot; by Edmund Wilson.  \n\nIf you reread what I wrote, I never mentioned the U.S. specifically taking the land....I said &quot;Europeans&quot;.  But, the U.S. indeed acquired millions of acres from the Native Americans by simply taking over hunting grounds and villages during the westward expansion.  The U.S. broke something in the neighborhood of 280 treaties with the natives.  No wonder they fought back and committed atrocities against the white man.  They were forced to move to reservations or further westward and then the US reduced the size of the reservations or simply forced them off reservations.  This continued into the 1960s when the US flooded a vast part of the Allegheny Reservation.  To help settle lawsuits the US allowed the Native Americans to &quot;own&quot; a certain number of casinos on their own reservation lands.  Big deal.  The US Govt stole lands from these people, took it right from under them.  \n\nNot only did the US take over reservation lands that were given to natives in treaties by the US, but this country allowed the senseless slaughter of millions of buffalo by men who simply let the animals pile up and rot on the prairies after shooting them from the Union Pacific RR.  So, a large source of  food and leather was taken away from the native Americans.  \n\nThe rest of the world turned a blind eye to what happened to the native Americans....the &quot;civilized&quot; world allowed a new nation to be built while destroying a &quot;savage&quot;, uncivilized one.   The &quot;savages&quot; were conquered and the US government has monitored immigration ever since.  People of all nationalities and countries have come here, but there have been quotas.  That is not the point.....it is a different nation now and there is no turning back.  It should never have happened in the first place.  Perhaps Henry Hudson should have paid a little more than he did for Manhattan.  Perhaps the white man should have been truly fair and offered something besides trinkets, lies and broken treaties for land here.  Look, I think the Native Americans got a raw deal, all the way around.  Now, how would you like it if an advanced race of human like beings appeared from outer space and herded Americans out of their homes onto some reservation on another planet?","The reservations were not sovereign nations, they were still part of the United States. The laws of eminent domain applied to the reservations back then and still apply today. As a sovereign nation the United States has the right to take any piece of land within it's borders and use it as it wishes. It doesn't matter if there is a private house on the land, or a private business, or anything else. That's the meaning of the word &quot;sovereignty&quot;. Because the &quot;Native Americans&quot; could not understand concepts like sovereignty and eminent domain they used force against innocent civilians who in turn had to be protected by the U.S. Army. \n\nSovereignty over this land was transfered from Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, and Russia to the United States. North America was taken away from the &quot;Native Americans&quot; long before the United States existed, it had nothing to do with the U.S. There are peoples and nations all over the world that have lost lands to conquerors, the &quot;Native Americans&quot; are not unique in this. The entire Middle East was conquered by Arabs and Turks who had no business there. The Copts, Assyrians, Byzantines, Hebrews, Babylonians etc..were the &quot;natives&quot; of the Middle East but they all had their lands conquered by the Arabs and Turks, and they all had their civilizations destroyed and replaced by that of the conqueror. \n\nNeed I remind you that the Mongolian cousins of the &quot;Native Americans&quot; were the most brutal and ruthless of all conquerors.\n\nBy the way, it was Peter Minuit who purchased Manhattan, and Americans should not have to answer for the actions of European colonialists and imperialists. Your beef seems to be with the colonial powers of Europe. The United States cannot be faulted for obtaining land from European powers and exercising sovereignty over that land. If the &quot;Native Americans&quot; want to get back at Peter Minuit, a 16th Century Dutchman, by scalping innocent U.S. citizens then they should expect a visit from the U.S. Army.","From Wikipedia:\n\nAnother dispute over American Indian government is its sovereignty versus that of the states. The federal U.S. government has always been the government that makes treaties with Indian tribes - not the states. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that “Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes”.[3] This determined that Indian tribes were separate from the federal or state governments and that the states did not have power to regulate commerce with the tribes, much less regulate the tribes. The states and tribal nations have clashed over many issues such as Indian gaming, fishing, and hunting. American Indians believed that they had treaties between their ancestors and the United States government, protecting their right to fish, while non-Indians believed the states were responsible for regulating commercial and sports fishing.[26] In the case Menominee Tribe v. United States in 1968, it was ruled that “the establishment of a reservation by treaty, statute or agreement includes an implied right of Indians to hunt and fish on that reservation free of regulation by the state”.[27] States have tried to extend their power over the tribes in many other instances, but federal government ruling has continuously ruled in favor of tribal sovereignty. A seminal court case was Worchester v. Georgia. Chief Justice Marshall found that “England had treated the tribes as sovereign and negotiated treaties of alliance with them. The United States followed suit, thus continuing the practice of recognizing tribal sovereignty. When the United States assumed the role of protector of the tribes, it neither denied nor destroyed their sovereignty.”[28] As determined in the Supreme Court case United States v. Nice (1916),[29] U.S. citizens are subject to all U.S. laws even if they also have tribal citizenship.\n\n                                     - from &quot;Tribal Sovereignty in the United States\n\nThe Mongolian conquerors you are referring to lived thousands of years after the migration of peoples who became the &quot;Native Americans.&quot;  Do you really believe that certain races of people are innately more ruthless than others?  I don't.","Indian reservations have always been considered independent of state governments, but that does not mean that they are independent sovereign nations equal in status with the United States, Belgium, Japan, or Argentina. They do not have a seat at the United Nations nor do they exchange ambassadors with foreign countries. Indian reservations are still subject to United States sovereignty, the land they sit on is U.S. territory. Indian tribes are sovereign in the same sense of the word as U.S. states are referred to as sovereign states. This is not the same sovereignty that nation states possess. Nation states have complete sovereignty over their land, this includes U.S. sovereignty over Indian reservations. Therefore the United States has the right of eminent domain over all tribal lands and has the legal right to seize that land for it's own use, provided that the tribes are given compensation. \n\nOnce the &quot;Native Americans&quot; lost their sovereignty to the European colonial powers the ball-game was over. North America ceased to be their land, however unjust this might have been. No more unjust than Egypt being ruled by Arabs. The history of humanity has been one long list of injustices, but we can only deal with reality as it exists now, not as we wish things could have been or should have been. When the United States acquired its land from Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, and Russia the &quot;injustice&quot; that the European nations had committed against the &quot;Native Americans&quot; was simply an historical footnote.","So you think the Native Americans have received just compensation from the US?  I don't.   Nearly 300 treaties with the US and all of them broken.  \n\nYou can choose to forget the past and move forward.  I choose to state here that there has never been just compensation for these people.  And that includes forcing the children to attend Christian schools where instead of being taught like white kids, they were mainly taught how to weave baskets and make brooms and how to &quot;fear the lord.&quot;  \n\nWe are going in circles here and no one else is even reading this.  I have other things to do.  I have written how I feel.  I don't even know whom I am arguing with.  The least you could do is get yourself an icon with your photo on it and have a name other than &quot;John Doe&quot; with absolutely no photo images on your stream and nothing about yourself.  I consider your sort a troll.  \n\nThis is what the &quot;new Flickr&quot; has morphed into.  Gradually, those of us who are serious about photography will be replaced by individuals who have nothing meaningful to contribute to the &quot;Flickr Community.&quot;  This is why it was foolish of Flickr to get rid of the Pro status of those of us who have paid for years and who helped Flickr grow, only to be destroyed by Marissa Mayer who knows absolutely nothing about photography, and, sadly, does not care.\n\nI'm outta here.","Nowhere near just compensation. I would grant them sovereignty over all lands west of the Mississippi. Not a popular view. But Miles' attitude was anti imperialism which made him unpopular with Teddy Roosevelt who was his boss.

His father, a gardener by occupation, was an amateur violinist. He taught his two sons the violin and after discovering Jan's talent, who was aged five at the time, arranged for him to study with Karel Weber and Darel Ondříček. Aged eight he studied at the Prague Conservatory with Otakar Ševčík, of whose technique he became the most famous representative. As a child, he used to practice 10 to 12 hours a day, or &quot;until my fingers started to bleed.&quot; After 1898, he toured as a soloist, soon becoming renowned for his great virtuosity and flawless intonation, and his very full and noble tone.

We retain the original title of a photograph as part of preserving the historical record. The Bain News Service photo titles are available from several sources—typed in the set of caption cards consulted while making the scans, hand-written on an older set of cards, and etched on the negatives themselves. Abbreviations are common in each source, and, in this case, the abbreviated term is the only form found.","Sorry, but I do not understand the need to title the photo by what is marked on the photo itself.  The photo stands by itself and there is no need to carry the offensive abbreviation to the title.  The title of the photo cannot be excused by the claim that it merely reflects what is written on the photo itself, as the choice of title is the free choice of the poster, the Library of Congress, and as such reflects the Library of Congress' own voice.\n\nIs it not the Library of Congress' own voice when titling a photo that contains no textual markings?  Does it not reflect the best judgment of the Library of Congress regarding the presumed factual (and not editorial) content of the photo?\n\nAnd what if extensive study shows that there exists photos in the collection that is marked in error with incorrect information?  Would you in fact title the photo with the incorrect information?  I suspect not, as it would be assumed that unless otherwise explicitly stated that the title is written in the voice of the Library of Congress.\n\nAnd are your methods such that any offensive comment written on a photo in your archives will also carry the same title on Flickr?\n\nAnd what is one to make of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163954104/\">this photo</a>, where a selective correction to the hand-written note was made when composing its title?\n\nPerhaps there can be a reasonable compromise.  There exists photos in your collection that makes a clear distinction between the Library of Congress' voice and that of whoever annotated the photo, with square brackets used to mark the poster's (Library of Congress') voice.  Perhaps that could be used in this case.  e.g.: &quot;[Japanese] gun commanding Seoul (LOC)&quot;\n\nPlease reconsider retitling this photo.  To use such racially loaded and derogatory abbreviations in an area that many would interpret as the Library of Congress' own voice is a very unwise choice and is not fitting the character of such a fine institution.\n\nThough I have not viewed all of your photos I have browsed through many of them and nowhere else do I see a similar offense committed.  This is a bad precedent to set and is all the more unusual and provocative in its uniqueness with respect to the rest of your collection.","This is history and proper documentation is always important, as affirmed by the staff members from the United States' most important library. Racism is highly improper in the modern day but the racist attitudes of former days (against Asian Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, Jewish Americans, Arab Americans, and others) does need to be properly documented, as any other historical aspect of my nation, however much I may disagree with such attitudes. In this way we may learn from the mistakes of our ancestors.\n\nExamples of such shameful, but formerly quite acceptable behavior may be seen at the following photos:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2787136484/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2787136484/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2786280191/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2786280191/</a>\n\nIn this particular photo's case, it isn't clear that a racist epithet was intended, as the original photo contains a caption that seems to include an abbreviation (it appears that there is a period), and, in any case, the Library of Congress uses the actual captions on the original photos (which, if incorrect or if need additional clarification, may be discussed here to solve any such difficulty). Editorializing and second-guessing historical texts is our job, not the Library's.","dbadagna: I agree with everything you say.  These historical records are treasure for preserving the attitudes, however shortsighted, of the times, and altering the record does history a great disservice.\n\nHowever I am not asking for the artifact to be altered in any way.  A title that is contemporaneously applied to a photo does not change the existing historical record.  The hand-written marks made at the time on the photo still remains intact to be studied and as testimony to the biases in currency at the time.\n\nHowever let it be understood that subsequent titles applied today are part of a new historical record, reflecting the voice of the person or organization adding the additional title.  Yes, the Library of Congress, by adding the title that it chose to add is in essence adding a new mark to the historical record with its own voice.\n\nUnfortunately a title applied to the photo in Flickr is not as indelible as the original mark made on the photo.  Already it is lost in the historical record that the Library of Congress re-titled 4 similar photos in this series of 7 by adopting the full spelling of &quot;Japanese&quot;.  The fact that those 4 photos started out on Flickr with a title using the derogatory abbreviation is important in preserving the history of the current debate but for all practical purposes is now lost to history.\n\nMy purpose for bringing the latter 4 examples up is to illustrate that these little skirmishes over the title and the Library of Congress' reversal in titling them is to illustrate the obvious: that despite all of this at no time was the interpretation, representation, or the content of the original artifact changed.  What we do now is part of a new historical record and does not in any way change the pre-existing artifact, record, or history.\n\nOne interesting observation re. the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2786280191/\">2nd of the two photos</a> that you referenced above.  In the case of the 2nd photo the Library of Congress dropped the reference to &quot;Savages&quot; in its title even though the scanned image clearly uses this term.  Would it be your argument that the Library of Congress now needs to abandon the current title for one that adds the missing word &quot;Savages&quot; of the original hand-written title?","The inconsistencies are duly noted, and it would be very helpful to have an explanation of these inconsistencies from the Library's staff.","Indeed...","Your comments gave us good food for thought!\n\nExpanding an abbreviated word in a title to clarify a spelling can be helpful, so we’ve added the fuller spelling in brackets. But this kind of bracketed interpolation is not intended to replace original vocabulary even when a word can cause offense. Quoting an original title is part of preserving historical context by reflecting how an item presented itself when first produced. Just as the Library doesn’t re-title books or movies, we don’t re-title pictures that come to us with formal titles. \n\nThe unbracketed titles that appear with Library of Congress images in Flickr are not the Library’s own voice. The titles are transcriptions of original text found with the historical photographs. If putting “(LOC)” at the ends of the titles is creating the impression that the Library is writing a new title, we need to rethink adding that indication of where the photo is from. (When a photograph lacks an original title, then a note is provided “Title devised by Library staff” and brackets appear around the entire title. There are also judgment calls when, for example, only a surname or multiple abbreviated words appear on a photo. In those cases, the photo may have been given a quick annotation rather than a formal title, and a descriptive title might be devised with an explanatory note about the title source.)\n\nYour comments are helpful for seeing that in the complicated situation with the Bain negatives, where there are multiple sources of historical caption information (two sets of cards and the negatives themselves), varying the title source can cause confusion. Especially when our source of title notes ambiguously cite multiple sources as “Title from unverified data provided by the Bain News Service on the negatives or caption cards.” We’d better stick with a single source-what can be seen in the negative.\n\nWe’ve started by making sure that the titles for the photos mentioned in the comments above match what’s written on the negatives rather than the caption cards.\n\nFYI, the published standard that guides our practice in describing the variety of pictures we preserve is called &quot;Graphic Materials: Rules for Describing Original Items and Historical Collections.&quot; It's available online at <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/gm/graphmat.html\">www.loc.gov/rr/print/gm/graphmat.html</a>.","stand by your guns! no reason to alter the historical record!","Appears to be a model.","The SS <i>Imperator</i> was a German passenger liner in 1913, at one time the largest ship in the world.

The presence of the portable flag leads me to suspect they could be on an army base during WWI:\n\n&quot;....Joining the USPA in 1902, the Army encouraged their cavalry units to participate in polo to improve their riding ability. From then until World War II, the U.S. Military would play a significant role in the sport of polo.&quot;\n\nthis quote is from <a href=\"http://www.sportpolo.com/History/default.htm\">www.sportpolo.com/History/default.htm</a>","Checking Newell Bent's American Polo (published by Macmillan in 1929) reveals that there was a series of international matches between American and British teams around this time. There was no such match in 1910, but there were matches in 1909 and 1911 (among other years). Comparing this photo to photos in the book shows similar uniforms (dark shirt, pith-type helmet with dark band around it) for the British teams; for example there's a photo of the 1914 British team on page 189. So I tentatively suggest that this might be a photo of one of the British international polo teams of that era.","BTW, when they say this is 1910s, it means it could be anytime within the decade of 1910-1919, Ammo.\n\nI should have known the guy on the left was a Brit officer.  He has a mustache.","Thanks, budderflyman. I based 1910 on the date given in the stats under the copyright notice. It turns out that there was international polo played in 1910 after all; there are lots of articles in the New York Times covering it. Matches (though not a match for the championship; that match was scheduled but then cancelled due to injury to one of the British riders) were played at Georgian Court in Lakewood, NJ, and at the Meadow Brook Hunt Club on Long Island, NY. Meadow Brook was also a venue for matches later on in the decade.","Ah, I see it now.  1910.  \n\nI wish we could find out where this was taken.  That is a huge house or clubhouse.  It does not look like the Meadow Brook clubhouse.  I wish someone at LOC could find out.

Although Meadow Brook polo players were involved in some of these matches, it appears no matches took place at Meadow Brook that year. I want to see if I can place that building in either NJ or RI, but haven't found anything yet.","Given that the photos in this collection are largely in rough chronological order and recent photos have been in early June 1913, this might be one of the matches in a series which was at Meadow Brook.

Courtney (November 13, 1849 – July 17, 1920) was an American rower and rowing coach from Union Springs, New York. A carpenter by trade, Courtney was a nationally known amateur rower. Courtney never lost as an amateur and finished a total of 88 victories.\n\nIn 1877 he moved from an amateur to a professional rower, a decision that Courtney would later regret. His professional career was marred by controversy and accusations including cowardice and race fixing. His professional career was best remembered for his controversial losses to Ned Hanlan. Some[who?] believe that the controversies surrounding the Hanlan and Courtney races caused a public backlash against professional rowing that eventually led to its death in the United States.\n\nAs his rowing career wound down, Courtney became involved in coaching at Cornell University. He coached Cornell’s rowing team from 1883 to 1920. His crews won 14 of 24 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta, varsity eight oared titles. He kept his position until he died in the summer of 1920.\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_E._Courtney\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_E._Courtney</a>","See Charles E.

Not all Bain captions have proved accurate, although the great majority of people and places do seem to be identified correctly, give or take spelling mistakes.\n\nBut, I find that the same picture is identified as being of Kurdish soldiers by the Brooklyn Museum.

But a militia would be okay for the &quot;faux emir&quot; -- as described in Morgan's text.

The club was a counterpart to the city’s famed Coaching Club, many members of which were husbands, fathers, and brothers to the members of the Ladies’ Club. The Ladies’ Club took regular trips to the different boroughs as well as longer road trips to destinations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; for a short time they even ran a small shuttle service through Manhattan.  Under the tutelage of renowned driving instructor Morris Howlett, most of the members became quite accomplished drivers.  Each year, the Club held a parade and review through Central Park onto Fifth Avenue.  The Club’s founder and president was Helen Benedict Hastings, wife of the famous architect Thomas Hastings, designer of the New York Public Library, the front façade of the U. S. Capitol Building, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery.  Other notable members of the Ladies’ Club included Mrs. Arthur Iselin (vice president), Louisa Gulliver Sheldon (secretary and treasurer), Marion Hollins, and Harriet Alexander.

Can't tell from the download.  At first I thought they were peppers but not with those trees in the background.  \n\nAgain the Jap reference needs to be changed.","Truly.  The title on the picture is clearly not abbreviated.  What's up with this?","Actually, the title does appear to be abbreviated: Jap. for Japanese and Calif. for California.  It also appears to be a direct transcription from the original file card.  \n\nEven if the original title had been offensive it would still be part of a historical document, and would hardly merit retroactive censorship, surely.","I was referencing the previous picture with the same title.  I think it was uploaded the week before this one.  LOC said they would retitle it.","Hello! The title in the catalog record was indeed copied from the original negative sleeve, in this instance, and not the negative itself. I'm afraid that our turnaround time for catalog record corrections has grown longer as we continue to collect data from our Flickr volunteers. I'll add this one to the list though. Thanks everyone for your time and patience!","When it is clear that Jap. (note the all important period) was intended as an abbreviation rather than a pejorative, what is there to correct?  \n\nI may be wrong, but I don't believe the term 'Jap', uttered as a pejorative, was in wide currency until the Second World War, some thirty years after the photo was taken.  The catalog card may not have been filled out in 1910, but must nonetheless have been written up well before the war.  Incidentally, during the First World War, which of course took place not long after 1910, Japan was an ally of the US and Britain, a fact that renders it much less likely that the notes accompanying the image were contemptuous in meaning.\n\nDuring the Second World War some very ugly racist propaganda directed at the Japanese was promulgated by the US Government and by news media.  The newspaper headlines, the Movietone News reels, the ubiquitous war propaganda posters all were ridden with the most offensive and racially charged imagery and wording.  As distasteful as these effusions of hatred are to us today, they are nonetheless historical documents.  They are reminders of aspects of American history that, while they do not make us proud, should not be ignored.  \n\nWhereas the desperate GI fighting tooth and nail against the tough Japanese garrison of some shell-blasted atoll can be forgiven for stooping to slinging racial epithets with his bullets and grenades, the attitudes engendered in the comfortable US civil populace by wartime propaganda are much more unsettling (see Vonnegut).  The resultant ill treatment of Japanese-Americans, most especially the outright theft of their homes and possessions, was indeed a shameful chapter in US history.  \n\nWe know what attitudes pervaded US society during WW2, but what of the earlier decades of the 20th Century?  Did a photographer or a file clerk really evince contempt for the Japanese in 1910?  Or did one of those people innocently abbreviate the word Japanese to Jap., just as he or she employed Calif. for California?  This is not unimportant, and the file card in question, written upon by a long dead hand nearly a century ago, may provide us a window, however tiny, on the sensibilities of the time.  Let us not, please, run through the archives with a marker, blotting out anything that may just possibly give offense.  Anyone with a genuine interest in history wants to hear the whole story, good and bad, and not some polished official version.\n\nAgain, I draw your attention to the . (period); it is significant.","Thank you for the thought out response.  I too consider the times when thinking of these things.  \n\nAnd I thank the LOC for these pictures and the desire they have to make them accurate.  I can't wait til the next Friday to see what we get next!","Yes, you are correct PN. As a rule, we do not change the language of original captions made by the creators of images in our collections. \n\nHowever, it would increase the image's &quot;findability&quot; in the Prints and Photographs Division's online catalog (PPOC), if the expanded title were to be included. As it is, a search for &quot;japanese california,&quot; for example, will not return this photo among the results as these two words are not spelled out anywhere in the catalog record. \n\nThank you very much for these points.","Lewis,\n\nThank-you for your response and your reassuring explanation of LOC policy.","Please reconsider retitling this photo to spell out Japanese.

Despite his nickname, he was not a Mexican national but a fourth generation Californian. He was a lightweight boxer whose ring career lasted from 1910 to 1923. \n\nIn 1912, he fought <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/adwolgast/\">Ad Wolgast</a> for the lightweight title. At the beginning of the thirteenth round, he and Wolgast both landed punches that sent the other down. Wolgast fell on top of Rivers, and referee Jack Welch helped Wolgast to his feet and began the count on Rivers. Welch declared Wolgast the winner by a technical knockout, in one of the most controversial decisions in the history of boxing.\n\nA video of the last thirty seconds of the famous &quot;double knockdown&quot; fight can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/jcbunnell/movie/\">this web page</a>.\n\nRivers had another shot at the lightweight title the next year when he fought <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/willieritchie/\">Willie Ritchie</a>, who had taken the title from Wolgast in November, 1912, but Ritchie knocked him out in the eleventh round.\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DE5DC153FE633A25756C0A9619C946296D6CF\">Here's the New York Times article</a> about the 1913 Rivers-Ritchie fight.\n\nFollowing his ring career, Joe Rivers played bit parts in a few movies, and was technical adviser on one of them. <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0729539/\">Here's his IMDb page</a>.\n\nDespite having made what was, for the time, a considerable fortune in the ring, Rivers' money eventually began to run out, and late in his life he was living in a windowless room in downtown Los Angeles.

Also note that the photos BobMeade linked to below do depict the former Phelps house, not the house in this photo.\n\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nThis Italianate brownstone house at the southeast corner of Madison Avenue and 37th Street in Manhattan was built in 1853 for Isaac N. Phelps of Phelps, Dodge &amp; Company. The house was purchased by financier J.P. Morgan in 1904, as a home for his son J.P. Jr., but the property passed out of the family's ownership in 1945. \n\nIn 1988, the house was purchased by the adjacent Morgan Library &amp; Museum, and it has since been incorporated into that institution's campus. The former dining room is now one of the institution's dining facilities, called appropriately enough the Morgan Dining Room. Two other restored rooms on the ground floor now house the Morgan Shop.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Morgan Library &amp; Museum web site</a>.","Also good views here:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2909004621/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2909004621/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3239313168/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3239313168/</a>\n\nIn both cases it is described as the home of J. P. Morgan, Jr.","This  is J. Pierpont Morgan's House on the northeast corner of  219 Madison Avenue and E. 36th St. It was the first private residence in the city to be lighted by electricity. See <a href=\"http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?712325F\" rel=\"nofollow\">digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?712325F</a>. The address here  says Park  Avenue and 36th which is incorrect.  Morgan Sr. lived here from 1880 to 1913, it was torn down in 1928. The house that Phelps built (copper mining tycoon) was the southeast corner of 229-231 Madison Avenue and E. 37th St. (J.P'Jack' Morgan Jr.'s house) which had in 1904, 45 rooms, 22 fireplaces and 12 bathrooms. The two houses and the Morgan Library were connected by underground passageways.","Hei! I am so impressed with your pic ;)\nHave a nice day ^.^","Actually, I think you were both right.     It's my understanding that all three freestanding brownstone houses on that side of Madison Avenue between 36th and 37th were built by the Phelps family, and at first they were identical to each other.     All three were remodeled to varying degrees  over the years, but they were clearly built using the same basic plans and materials      The New York Times archives has photos of the deconstruction of the middle house - which at that time was generally known as the Dodge Mansion -  and by viewing the three buildings together,  their similarities become very obvious.    The first thing Morgan Senior did after buying his  own house was to move the entrance stoop.    The front doors of all three homes were originally located on Madison Ave, but Morgan replaced his home's original stoop with the large rounded bay (that's seen in the above photo) and placed this new entrance on 36th St..   He also hired the Herter Brothers to remodel and redecorate the interiors.     The Dodge Mansion, at the time of its demolition at least, had a central entrance with rounded bays on either side of it, and the various changes made to Jack Morgan's house on the corner of 37th St. are pretty easy to spot when comparing it to his father's original house.\n\nI assume they're probably calling this the &quot;MRS. J.P. Morgan House&quot; because the picture above was taken after Morgan's death in 1913 but while Fanny Morgan was still using the place as her city residence.    She really preferred their country place, Cragston, but nobody in the Morgan's set would think of living in the country year-round, not in those days.","According to Frederick Lewis Allen who wrote, &quot;the great Pierpont Morgan&quot; in 1948 the three Dodge-Phelps houses were built in the 1850's on the East side of Madison Ave. between between thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh streets. All three brownstone houses had &quot;ample&quot; gardens behind them&quot;.  In 1880 he bought the southernmost of the three houses-the one at the corner of Thirty-sixth which had originally belonged to Issac N. Phleps. It stood where the white marble annex of the Morgan Library now stands and &quot;roughly resembled the remaining brownstone house at the corner of Madison and Thirty-seventh- which in 1948 was the sole survivor of that group of houses&quot;.","I have since run across this postcard image taken while all three of the original Dodge-Phelps houses were still standing.  <a href=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/13201523223_3a0bc51e55_o.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/13201523223_3a0bc51e55_o.jpg</a>","^ These three houses were built in 1854, 1) by Isaac N. Phelps, on the corner of Thirty-seventh Street; 2) John Jay Phelps, on the corner of Thirty-sixth Street; and 3) William E. Dodge (who married Melissa Phelps, daughter of Anson Greene Phelps), in the middle. At that time Madison Avenue extended only to\nForty-second Street.   Isaac Newton Phelps was a banker and nothing to do with Phelps Dodge.  His son in law, Anson Phelps Stokes was and so was next door William E Dodge.  Anson's son was architect Isaac newton Phelps Stokes and he was born in 229 Madison Avenue.  Anson and his wife Helen went on to own 229 and sold it to Morgan.

We must thank\nShepherd, Nicholas H., the photographer for taking this picture of the president. \n\nThe picture of the president is a great memory of a great man!","Lincoln was a tyrant.","<b>idswart</b>, lincoln probably was a tyrant. wikipedia outlines the most basic aspects of this, saying he:\n\n&quot;suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money before Congress appropriated it, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.&quot;\n\nLincoln violated the rule of law, the constitution, the human rights of thousands - to a much greater extent than any president that came before him.\n\nthe very troubling thing is that out of this tyranny, and perhaps even because of this tyranny, the even greater tyranny of slavery was ended. when we look at Lincoln we see an incredibly complicated figure who challenges our ideas of what is just and what is right from many different directions.\n\nit does depend somewhat on your definition of tyranny though. Lincoln never declared himself emperor or king or president-for-life, which is usually what people think of when they think of tyrants. this is why even though Lincoln violated the constitution and trampled on rights throughout the course of the civil war, it is difficult to put him in the same class as Napoleon or Mao.","I agree with most of what you had to say, but I believe that the original Constitutional Republic built by our founding fathers ceased to be after the end of the War Between the States.","this picture looks least like the Lincoln memorialized in later representations.  i guess this is who you would have seen in a court room or legal library, before politics.","Everything is in tack sharp focus except his left hand.

A foreign power invaded the mainland united states in the war of 1812, and you didn't see a nationwide suspension of habeus corpus for that.\n\nimmediately after the war the supreme court ruled that Lincoln's actions had been unconstitutional, that it wasn't constitutional to suspend habeus corpus in areas where courts were still functioning - which is what Lincoln did. so it isn't like the &quot;men of his times&quot; in the legal world thought what Lincoln did was normal or just. his actions were deemed unconstitutional by his contemporaries.\n\nnone of this diminishes what Lincoln accomplished for the cause of freedom, but it prompts difficult questions about the nature of freedom and how it is secured. these questions shouldn't be dismissed because of some glib notion that people in the &quot;olden days&quot; didn't know any better.","Your photo is uploaded here :\n<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Shepherd,_Nicholas_H_-_The_Library_of_Congress_-_Abraham_Lincoln,_Congressman-elect_from_Illinois._Three-quarter_length_portrait,_seated,_facing_front_(pd).jpg\">commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Shepherd,_Nicholas_H_-_Th...</a>\n\n--\n<i><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/\">Seen on your photo stream.</a></i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\">?</a>)</em>","Tell that to the 650,000 Americans he slaughtered...how's that for human rights?

The idea of business as usual, in a time when a major chunk of the country was trying to secede, violating the Union? Ridiculous.\n\nFunny how people can't understand that in times of war, normal &quot;rights&quot; are removed. It's man against man, trying to take your LIFE -- how's that for a right removed? It's not a civilized thing, war. It totally abrogates the social contract and the most fundamental moral codes. This idea that there's an honorable way to conduct wars is asinine and shameful. It's what allows us to calmly enter into them in the first place, what allows us to be genuinely surprised that the whole endeavor isn't a neatly conducted game ... that makes it possible for anyone to be shocked that &quot;civilians&quot; are often put in harm's way. What? Is the horrid intent of war not clear? Does anyone think the human damage can really be contained to the poor pawns in uniform? Or that doing so would make the killing in any sense more morally just? Jesus help us, people are stupid. There are times when war is called for. But if you believe that, and enter into it, don't have on blinders.\n\nBy the way, the Union wasn't fighting to end slavery. The Union was fighting because those who wanted to preserve and spread the right to enslave, wanted to secede. The Union wanted the vast wealth of the natural resources in the south. They wanted to keep the contiguous land mass united. They couched it in terms of slavery, at times, because those were the terms by which secession was made. Yes, 18 months into the War, an emancipation proclamation was floated -- but emancipation would never have been a reason for war, on its own. Well, not from the Union offensive stance.","<i>&quot;None of his predecessors were dealing with a civil war. The idea of business as usual, in a time when a major chunk of the country was trying to secede, violating the Union? Ridiculous.&quot;</i>\n\nIn the war of 1812, foreign troops attacked and occupied Washington DC, setting the white house and Capitol on fire. The war wasn't on as large a scale as the civil war, but the idea that Lincoln was alone in facing an existential threat to the Union is unfounded. The revolutionary war itself was an existential threat to nationhood itself, and the people who fought it wrote the very provisions that Lincoln flaunted.\n\n<i>&quot;The idea of business as usual, in a time when a major chunk of the country was trying to secede, violating the Union? Ridiculous.&quot;</i>\n\nnobody is talking about &quot;business as usual&quot;. martial law and the suspension of habeus corpus happens often in times of war, when the mechanisms of civil justice are often unavailable. If there's no functioning judiciary in an area of conflict, such chaos is inevitable and cruder methods of maintaining order are understandable.\n\nLincoln's issue was that he suspended habeus corpus in areas with functional courts, well within union territory. he essentially short circuited a functional judicial system.\n\nwas this necessary? i'm not sure. maybe. but it was certainly a power grab and set a precedent for a consolidation of executive power that continues to this day.","I said none of his predecessors faced a *civil* war.\n\nAs for his tactics re the judicial system -- the thrust of my comment was meant to say, if killing is okay, why should other rights be safe? To pretend any other kinds of rights should be carefully handled, if the right to life is being systematically taken away, is a philosophically absurd notion. That we can both have a designated time of killing those with whom we do not agree, and parade about like idiots, keeping to the letter of all other man-made laws -- that's what allows such brutality to happen, the idea that when we're engaging in the absolute antithesis of our reason for being (sustenance of life) by killing each other, we can still be &quot;civilized&quot; and orderly. Putting war in a context like that -- even expecting it -- means one is not possibly grasping how very wrong it is to kill, as if the killing is less of a transgression than imprisonment or loss of privacy, or even torture.\n\nAnd again, I don't think all war is wrong. But understand that it is utterly anti-social, anti-life, anti-civility. To expect otherwise is to be naive, and disappointed. Just because during some wars we *have* maintained levels of continuity of our governmental systems, and maintained the everyday workings of the social contract, doesn't impress me as good. It impresses me as sick, that we were able to compartmentalize a very animalistic way of settling differences. Again -- a way sometimes necessary, but not to be confused with business as usual.","<i>&quot;ALL is &quot;fair&quot; in war. If killing is okay, nothing is safe.&quot;</i>\n\nbut that has no bearing on how you treat you own citizens in times of war. in war, the other side is the enemy, not your own people. if you have traitors in your midst, that can be established fairly, by a functioning judiciary.\n\nanother more modern example, britain survived imminent invasion and mass bombing without suspending habeus corpus in WWII.","We weren't invaded. It was in our midst, it was our own people, and not on clear-cut lines. Within the same households, both north and south, there was division. It would have been chaos to try to take the time to figure out who was or was not a traitor, by the long process of the law. You do your best with information at hand, when quick decisions must be made -- just as I'm sure there were men with guns on fields, unable to tell for sure who was the enemy. But you can't just stand there, and wait to figure it out. Again, being in the midst of a war isn't a good place to be.\n\nIt seems to me we've turned war into a codified, acceptable means of conflict resolution, by giving it rules and regulations in and of itself, and in seeking to continue all non-wartime rules and regulations just as they are in peacetime. We make it seem as if &quot;war&quot; is just part of the bigger picture, something that stands by itself, that shouldn't upset the normal fabric of life. I don't think that makes sense, morally or practically.\n\nAs a last point, since I come off sounding totally anti-war -- I'll reiterate that at times, I think it's called for. But that if it is, it should be understood, nothing and no one is safe. And again, they oughtn't be. If it's okay for anyone to die, than it should be reason enough for everyone to die -- it should only be done for reasons of survival in the first place, where your military and people would die anyway, if you didn't engage (i.e. your most basic resources are imminently threatened, your lives are directly threatened).","<i>&quot;We weren't invaded. It was in our midst, it was our own people, and not on clear-cut lines. Within the same households, both north and south, there was division.&quot;</i>\n\nsame with the revolutionary war, which was fought by the people who wrote the constitution that Lincoln flaunted.\n\n<i>&quot;It seems to me we've turned war into a codified, acceptable means of conflict resolution, by giving it rules and regulations in and of itself, and in seeking to continue all non-wartime rules and regulations just as they are in peacetime.&quot;</i>\n\nthat's because the law protects human rights, which we should endeavour to protect at all times, especially in wartime. it isn't about turning war into an acceptable means of conflict resolution, it's about understanding that rights are inalienable, not privileges to be whisked away simply because there's a war on.","To think that human rights exist somehow <i>a priori</i>, that they persist in a vacuum, or that they shall endure without a host nation is terminally naive.\n\nThey are merely ideals, and not at all immutable, given form or verse simply by those in concert willing to make difficult choices to, above all else, protect themselves from material harm.","I would assert further that idealism is at its heart a peacetime proposition, a luxury borne of leisure, hurled so loosely in philosophical corridors. And that it is often aimed, ironically enough, at the warrior ilk that keeps the barbarians at bay, such that those discussions, however noble in speculation, may persist, is among the grander ironies.","And whilst I rant from those aforementioned corridors of leisure and food aplenty, I am curious: for those who would brand Lincoln a tyrant, who among the American pantheon do <i>you</i> admire?","Striatic,\n\nWe disagree about the Civil War being comparable to the Revolutionary War.\n\nAnd as far as I see it, the law doesn't protect human rights. The law protects civil order. It's possible to do so in a way that hinders human rights, in fact. Our system is not one that does so, it's true that we seek to optimize human rights in the pursuit and maintenance of peace. But in a time of war, when one feels the populace is threatened, it may be that maintaining civil order and the safety of the majority, means there will be some whose human rights will be compromised. Not nice? Well, don't have a war. \n\nLincoln didn't randomly take away rights of his own citizens. It seems he believed himself unable to secure the safety of the greater number, without suspending habeas corpus. As I understand it, he wasn't happy to act outside of the Constitutional provisions, he believed it to be a genuinely necessary matter of expediency. And in the context, I don't think it can be well argued that he was wrong. The men he sought to snare were not &quot;his own,&quot; they were the enemy, among his own. I made the analogy above, I'll make it again: if you are in a battle, and you are going to judge the entire success in terms of losses by friendly fire, you ought not be in the battle in the first place. If you aren't ready to sacrifice yourselves a bit to quash the opponent, the opponent wasn't worth fighting. Lincoln believed the Union was worth preserving. He was in the fight to win. He sacrificed the lives of many, many men to do so. Did the possibility that a few of the suspected traitors he imprisoned and/or executed were innocent, weigh heavily on his mind? I've no idea. It had to have been balanced by the responsibility he felt to the entire Union, acknowledging the risk that real traitors would have posed to a great number of men.\n\nIt's not an exact science, this playing about with morality. That's what I'm saying -- once you're in a war, it's not as black and white as it is in peacetime. It's not that a leader has carte blanche to transgress the status quo altogether, but the truth is, the worst transgression against human rights is already in play: the systematic killing of others. Ostensibly, it is done for a &quot;just&quot; reason -- anyway, one you consider worth the sacrifice of others. And so Lincoln did, on the battlefield, and possibly, in the courtroom.","&quot;They are merely ideals, and not at all immutable, given form or verse simply by those in concert willing to make difficult choices to, above all else, protect themselves from material harm.&quot;\n\nBeautifully stated.\n\n&quot;I would assert further that idealism is at its heart a peacetime proposition ...&quot;\n\nAbsolutely.","you're defending Lincoln by saying that rights are luxuries. unbelievable.\n\nsaying that America's constitutional ideals were born of leisure and peace is also unbelievable.","Make no mistake, the nations <i>themselves</i> which are the safe havens in which those ideals best flourish are forged of blood and iron. In this way, the principles that guide said founding necessarily precede it. \n\nIf these notions are conceived, authored, embraced or otherwise <i>beforehand,</i> it is the calm before the storm that lays witness to their genesis. How then can you so vehemently rebuke the premise that - regardless of the approaching storm clouds, and in spite of the semantics - those ideals owe to the reflection and discourse afforded as a luxury of peacetime?","reflection and discourse are not &quot;luxuries of peacetime&quot;. reflection and discourse are what human beings *do*. we are communicative creatures. we also fight each other over differences, but that is no more or less important to our liberty and security than our ability to find mutual interests and sustain prosperity through reflection and discourse.\n\nsometimes that discourse falls apart and people have to die to defend their interests, but we don't all live with knives at each others throats as you seem to insist.\n\nreflection and discourse are necessary implements of building mutual understanding and shared prosperity, not &quot;goodies&quot; you get after stabbing or shooting a bunch of people.","<i>&quot;that's because the law protects human rights, which we should endeavour to protect at all times, especially in wartime... it's about understanding that rights are inalienable, not privileges to be whisked away simply because there's a war on. &quot;</i>\n\nJust as a matter of accounting, what percentage of the Earth's billions enjoy these &quot;inalienable&quot; rights?\n\nCertainly not half - do you think one third? One fourth? It's starting to sound more like a privilege than a birthright to me.","I never said rights are luxuries. I said that if you're on board with taking away the most basic of human rights (If you accept that killing is an acceptable tool for conflict resolution), it seems a curious hypocrisy to worry about any other human right. That Lincoln, believing he was mitigating loss of life for many, made the difficult decision to *possibly* take the liberty or even life of one or two innocents. But I gather you would rather he had stood on principle. Principle that would have undoubtedly resulted in traitors taking action that mortally endangered thousands, left free many foul quislings, and yes, avoided harm to a few men falsely accused. In that time of war, Lincoln apparently didn't feel he had the luxury to pursue to its bitter end a principle that in peacetime it would have been unthinkable to transgress. He considered the protection of the majority of his people, not the few, which seems to me eminently responsible. A difficult choice, made in an extraordinary time in our history.","&quot;Just as a matter of accounting, what percentage of the Earth's billions enjoy these &quot;inalienable&quot; rights?&quot;\n\ndepends on what you mean by &quot;enjoy&quot;.\n\nand you're avoiding the point. if rights, discourse and reflection are what keep us from murdering each other over absolutely every issue that crops up, how can they be &quot;luxuries&quot;? they're necessities.","&quot;I never said rights are luxuries.&quot;\n\nno. you merely thought that the sentiment was &quot;beautifully stated&quot;.","Likewise, does your apparent distaste at conceding that the discourse of ideologues flourishes during periods of peace-and-plenty somehow suggest that they are instead birthed of the toils of war? And perhaps even by the warriors themselves, on battlefields seldom of their own choosing, and not the scholars and whitebeards that debate endlessly, in their marble halls, far from the reach of the enemy?\n\nThen, I suppose, as goes the war, so too then the ideals? \n\nErgo, the side with the more able soldiers, the more capable generals, and the greater resources gets to pick which set of lofty ideals shall dominate after peace is established - or imposed. If these really are inalienable rights, and not subjective privileges simply afforded the victorious, then it seems curious and moreover cruel that they often hinge on something so fickle as a harsh winter or an impassible strait! \n \nHow precarious, then, these rights that Providence anoints but seldom appoints!","And, of course, when push does come to shove, &quot;stabbing and shooting&quot; are of course more noble than listening in on fifty people's phone calls. Better to just kill them, rather than usurp anyone's &quot;rights&quot; - right? \n\nAnd in the name of all that is holy, please don't play that Britn*y Spears music <i>too</i> loud: that wouldn't be nice.","No, I am saying (I won't speak for PopKulture) that if you do not have peace, relative prosperity, and stability, you aren't going to be able to sit around and wax rhapsodic about philosophic ideals, as we are doing now. That it is a luxury to have the time and lack of danger all about, or crop to harvest or else starvation is imminent, so that one can live the life of the mind and banter semantics about &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;human rights.&quot;\n\nAnd the rights themselves seem to follow as a luxury, because if you don't have time or money to sit about debating with other like-minded men at Fraunces Tavern about how mean it is for the Crown to tax you without representation, then you aren't going to go after those rights, are you? And today, the people working in sweatshops in SE Asia aren't enacting social and political change, because they're too damn busy breaking their backs from dawn til dusk. I think they would consider some of the political rights we enjoy as a luxury, and certainly the time to sit at laptop computers pontificating about the finer points of ethics, an overwhelming luxury.","&quot;no. you merely thought that the sentiment was &quot;beautifully stated&quot;. \n\nHe didn't say anything about rights, in the statement I reacted to. And I may not have been in agreement with his <i>thinking</i> -- I said it was beautifully stated, complimenting his writing. I happen to agree with him, however. It is absolutely true that the ideals with which the Constitution are imbued, do not stand alone as abstract truths.\n\nNow, he did go on to say that &quot;idealism is a peacetime proposition.&quot;  So it is. The founders, if you'd like to focus on them, did all their pre-revolution idealizing in a very peaceful environment. A stable one. Any pre-revolutionary violence was by the fomentation of those unhappy with the British rule, and it was minor. I don't disagree with what they did, but please -- they were all of them incredibly elite, wealthy, leisure-class men. Jefferson, Franklin et al. were of course industrious in many ways ... also a reflection of their utter financial freedom, and a peaceful environment. They were able to sit around, conceiving of political philosophy, scientific and agrarian experimentation, etc. Sounds like a luxurious life to me.","So markedly right, Julia. I hold all of the aforementioned in utter esteem, by the way, for making the difficult choices they made. \n\nThe fact remains that this proverbial &quot;calm before the storm&quot; coincided with a relatively peaceful and prosperous time.","Yes ... and funny, for as apparently holy as some consider them, or anyway, their writings, they certainly did suspend a very important human right, when they decided that their right to the pursuit of happiness warranted butchering the Redcoats, eh?\n\n(Not that the British wouldn't -- and didn't -- do the same, to try to secure *their* interests.)\n\nGranted, like you, I'm glad they did, and that they prevailed. But as far as I can tell, we're all of us willing to suspend our lofty ideals and others' inalienable rights, in the process of securing <i>our</i> inalienable rights. That's human nature, it seems to me.","<i>&quot;depends on what you mean by 'enjoy'.&quot;</i>\n\nYou choose.\n\nTell us what totalitarian regime makes the grade, what dictator makes the cut-off, what kingdom receives high marks. I'm sincerely curious. I fully feel it goes a long way to resolving the almost arbitrary and admittedly semantic <i>rights v. privilege</i> question.\n\nLikewise, as we've certainly seen here, criticism is by no means a scarce commodity.\n\nI fully admire Lincoln. I admit it. His presidency coincided with one of the most difficult periods in our history.\n\nI petition again, with the same curiosity - who do you admire?","&quot;I petition again, with the same curiosity - who do you admire? &quot;\n\ni don't particularly care about satisfying your curiosity.\n\n&quot;Tell us what totalitarian regime makes the grade, what dictator makes the cut-off, what kingdom receives high marks.&quot;\n\npeople under all types of regimes have rights that they are denied. you can deserve rights that are denied to you. in that case someone is hardly &quot;enjoying&quot; their rights. slaves in the confederacy were not granted rights by an army led by some benevolent white man who decided to take on the south, but were freed to enjoy their inalienable rights as human beings.\n\nthis isn't merely a semantic point. it relates to whether the former slaves were somehow indebted to the union or not for &quot;granting&quot; them rights.\n\n&quot;when they decided that their right to the pursuit of happiness warranted butchering the Redcoats, eh?&quot;\n\noh please. &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; is a wonderful concept, but it was hardly the only ideal the revolutionaries were fighting for. don't be glib.\n\n&quot;They were able to sit around, conceiving of political philosophy, scientific and agrarian experimentation, etc. Sounds like a luxurious life to me.&quot;\n\nand yet despite this they were all going to get hanged as traitors if they failed. fancy that.","Yes! Exactly! They would all have been hanged as traitors ...\n\n&quot;reflection and discourse&quot; ARE &quot;goodies&quot; you get after stabbing or shooting a bunch of people!!\n\nThere are no abstract rights, without sponsorship -- not <i>in practice</i>, anyway.\n\nThe rights that prevail are <i>certainly</i> part of the spoils enjoyed by the victorious. Do you think that the U.S. would be defined by a Judeo-Christian ethical spirit, if the Native Americans had successfully defended their land? What if Europeans had been allowed to live here, but not as a dominating force ... don't you think the ethical code that would characterize our government would have more to do with some synthesis of the idea of the divine held by the indigenous Americans?\n\nAcross the globe, people fight to the death for the right not just to live by their own set of beliefs, but to live <i>without having to be anywhere near anyone that doesn't believe as they do.</i> It seems to me they fight so that they can reflect and discourse on their own terms, and no one else's. To them, ideology *is* a commodity -- the supremacy of which, can be determined by violence.\n\nI'm being a little difficult -- I do see that you're saying that the right to actually discuss and reflect is a human right not bartered by war. That's sort of true, but just keep in mind ... Sitting at the head of the &quot;reflection and discourse&quot; table are those with political or economic power. For better or worse, they set the agenda, and the collective values of a government or educational system, will reflect what they consider most important.\n\nJust like it did at the Constitutional Conventions.\n\nPS You think the pursuit of happiness, with all that implies, was used as a glib rejoinder? Not at all. I'll put it this way -- &quot;when they decided that their right to liberty warranted butchering the redcoats.&quot; Does that sound like a right more worth taking someone's life for? Don't be afraid to say so, if it is. Jesus, if you believe SOME rights are worth dying for, then where was Lincoln wrong? Was he not sacrificing lives (who cares on what side -- they were all human beings) for an ideal he held sacred? Or is it that *you* are the arbiter of what constitutes a Just War? Perhaps it isn't Lincoln's actions that bother you, but that he  did them to support an economic and political war, not one about ultimate Human Rights? Gah.","<i>” and you're avoiding the point. if rights, discourse and reflection are what keep us from murdering each other over absolutely every issue that crops up, how can they be &quot;luxuries&quot;? they're necessities.”</i>\n\nWhoa! I never said “rights” had anything to do with keeping us from murdering each other. That little measure of co-existence owes to our individual guiding principles and ethics in addition to the proscriptions - and penalties - of the civil law, and moreover, at its heart, our innate fear that we may, in the process of attempting said murder, fail and invite mortal harm instead upon ourselves! It’s that animal instinct of self-preservation that helps us steer clear of dire situations like that, not rights.\n\nNow, admittedly, thoughtful reflection and discourse are valuable tools in avoiding mortal conflict once disagreement and resentment fester. At the negotiation table, however, where compromise is the watchword by which most conflicts are mitigated, then aren’t those so-called inalienable rights by definition compromised in the process, at least for someone?\n\nTake, for example, something as commonplace as the peaceful exchange between dissimilar nations of a commodity like oil. Fleets of tankers leave Middle Eastern shores on an almost daily basis, and we happily send them a tidy bouquet of promissory debt and everyone’s happy. Mostly. \n\nIn the case of the S*udis, we periodically take our seat at an oaken table in lavish staterooms, armed with our material needs, our multicultural relativism, and our ability-forged-of-necessity to look the other way, and we’re able to initiate and perpetuate this peaceable exchange. Now, where do the ol’ inalienable rights come into play again?? I’m sorry – is this where noble civility and that dose of compromise I mentioned above conspire to ignore said rights? \n\nI mean, we certainly get to talk about it enough. We’ve gone back and forth many times here already, and enjoyably (admit it) at that, brandishing about philosophical points like so many ping pong balls. We’ve got the leisure time, the electricity, the connectivity, and actual hardware and so on to make it all happen. I would submit to you, that I bet if we even get hungry, there’s food in the refrigerator! (Pretty nice luxury.)\n\nWell, I’m sorry now to burst the proverbial bubble I’ve so recently constructed, but we’ve come away from that table with <i>our</i> rights intact, sure… we do it almost everyday. And what are those rights again? And where are those same rights for the S*udi woman that wants to – I don’t know - hop in her car and take a spin over to the local university where she can learn the language and maybe take a few classes in western philosophy, thereby enabling her to jump right on in on our philosophical musings? \n\nThey’re not <i>hers.</i> We didn’t even bring them to the table. No one did. That’s reality, subjective and indifferent. So regarding the mere existence of inalienable rights, we therefore owe an enormous debt of gratitude and awe to a system that even enables us to think thus!!","<i>&quot;i don't particularly care about satisfying your curiosity.&quot;</i>\n\nAhh, it's much easier to criticize, isn't it?\n\nHow sad a retreat - especially for someone so ready to decry one of our national heroes, and heroic by consensus - but that one might not offer up one of their own.","<i>&quot;especially for someone so ready to decry one of our national heroes, and heroic by consensus&quot;</i>\n\n&quot;decry&quot; is overstating it. i said that &quot;the very troubling thing is that out of this tyranny, and perhaps even because of this tyranny, the even greater tyranny of slavery was ended. when we look at Lincoln we see an incredibly complicated figure who challenges our ideas of what is just and what is right from many different directions.&quot;\n\nfor all you know, Lincoln is actually the president i revere the most, and i simply don't revere him totally or wish to dismiss his mistakes.\n\n<i>&quot;It’s that animal instinct of self-preservation that helps us steer clear of dire situations like that, not rights.&quot;</i>\n\nyeah, because i'm not out murdering people right now because i'm afraid of lethal injection. or getting killed in the attempt. i feel empathy toward no one, only fear of repercussions.\n\notherwise i'd be totally hacking up my neighbours to steal all their cool stuff, pursuing my happiness.\n\n<i>&quot;At the negotiation table, however, where compromise is the watchword by which most conflicts are mitigated, then aren’t those so-called inalienable rights by definition compromised in the process, at least for someone?&quot;</i>\n\nno. not by definition. we negotiate many things other than rights.\n\n<i>&quot;I mean, we certainly get to talk about it enough. We’ve gone back and forth many times here already, and enjoyably (admit it) at that, brandishing about philosophical points like so many ping pong balls.&quot;</i>\n\ni don't enjoy it one bit. i'm rather surly and upset right now, and i don't think of it as a &quot;ping pong ball&quot; in any way whatsoever. if you're finding this entertaining, great. live it up.\n\n<i>&quot;They’re not hers. We didn’t even bring them to the table. No one did. That’s reality, subjective and indifferent.&quot;</i>\n\nit is certainly a messed up situation, which in the long run doesn't really benefit either side. it's sort of a codependent relationship.\n\nbut prosperous democratic societies aren't innately dependent on exploiting or supporting repressive regimes. it isn't a question of &quot;exploit or starve&quot;. more like &quot;exploit or live somewhat less lavishly&quot;. It isn't like non-democratic states are the only ones with oil, or that oil is the only possible basis for a prosperous economy.","<i>&quot;To them, ideology *is* a commodity -- the supremacy of which, can be determined by violence.&quot;</i>\n\nto them.\n\n<i>&quot;I'm being a little difficult&quot;</i>\n\nmore than.","&quot;to them&quot;\n\nYes, and &quot;them&quot; includes the founding fathers!\n\nSuch reasoning was exactly what caused the founders to take up arms against the British -- an imminent threat to their ideals, and by extension, their survival. And really, to their luxurious survival, because the British weren't exactly forcing Americans to live in poverty and duress. But the Americans wanted intellectual and economic sovereignty. They wanted all the fruits of their livelihoods' efforts. They weren't *forced* to kill the Redcoats, but they wanted what they wanted, and so, these giants of abstract morality incited a nation to take arms against their oppressors. Glad they did, but let's not say they did so simply as paragons of moral virtue and champions of the inalienable rights of men. To them, the right to privacy and liberty was as important as food because those ideals translate into the right to be personally sovereign, to having the power to secure resources, and have that effort be wholly beneficial to them, over the long run. And they put themselves and others in harm's way to ensure the freedom to do so.\n\n&quot;more than&quot;\n\nNice.

In practice, we can't say, &quot;all or nothing&quot; but on a philosophical level, I firmly believe that if it's okay to KILL other people, it is a little ridiculous to get so overwrought about other human rights, like ... well, any other rights.\n\nI guess I already explained that in the context of the comment from which that quote was taken. (BTW, I have edited that phrasing to say, &quot;if killing is okay, why should other rights be safe?&quot;) Again, I do understand why one needs to keep society stable and offer a continuity of order, even in a time of war -- I am simply calling into question why we can do that, and yet still find it necessary to rob others of their most basic human right. Well, I know why, I'm not a romantic: there are limited resources, and we're animals. But the marriage of our reason and our natures makes for a curious mix, in my eyes.\n\nThis is my opinion. I think my understanding is fine. You may not agree with my understanding of the matter, which is also fine.","Julia, I think I mistook your original meaning.  I don't think I've ever had anything particularly good happen to me when I start talking politics and issues on here, I should just shut up and let art stay art...\nI initially took your comment to mean that you were against all war for any reason (defensive or offensive).  That clearly wasn't what you meant.  I think I agree on most stuff with you as I look into it deeper.  You're edit made it a lot more clear.  I should have shut up at least until I looked at it better, sorry.","Oh, well, thanks. But you absolutely shouldn't shut up! I genuinely don't think that we all need agree, and I really do just enjoy sharing ideas, even if disparate.\n\nI do appreciate you going back and trying to understand my view, even if you hadn't come out (somewhat) agreeing.","It is the times that create the man!","Anyone who is looking at a 200 year old image of anything and  not appreciating that fact alone is on the wrong website. We are photographers here. We're sharing our eyes to the world with everyone so that they might have a larger understanding, a moment of inspiration, a connection, or a rejection. But, even if it is a rejection, this community is generally supportive, constructive, or silent. We're photographers here - not politicians.  Can you imagine if you posted a photograph that anyone would care at all about in 200 years, regardless of subject matter? Politics don't belong here.","It is an amazing photograph. But it wasn't taken back in 1847 as a celebration of photography, nor is it shared here as such. It was significant then as it is significant now: as a piece of material history, specifically important because of the <i>subject</i>.\n\nI have discovered in the last four years here that flickr is not merely a place to discuss photography. Many of us also routinely discuss issues or feelings that are inspired by the photographs we see posted. Taking part in those discussions is completely voluntary.\n\nIn this case, the discussion was prompted by an image of a politician; it was absolutely topical. And I disagree -- we are all politicians, or so Solon intended: we live in a democracy, where it is our right (some might say our responsibility) to actively discuss our political beliefs. One needn't take advantage of that freedom, or fulfill that responsibility, but I don't think it is appropriate to tell others to refrain from such interaction.","<i>&quot;We're photographers here - not politicians.&quot;</i>\n\nyou don't know who flickr is for and who it isn't for. you've made an assumption that it it is a website devoted *solely* to photographic art, and are wrong. \n\n<i>&quot;Politics don't belong here.&quot;</i>\n\nof course they do, and you just shared yours very plainly with us.","Thank you for your thoughtful comments. I think it is just wishful thinking on my part. :)","If you mean you wish flickr comment threads were only ever about the art and science of photography, then you are in luck: when you see a series of comments that seem to diverge from that course, you are only one click away from relief.","I actually love politics and discussing them. I don't expect people to agree and I do appreciate the art of debate. After I thought more about it the comments in the boxes all over the photo are what set me off. I took it as very intrusive and interfering with the photo. I am fascinated with the artifact itself, and the politics were distracting.  I don't know if it's my browser but I can't get the note boxes to go away. In any case, my comments were spur of the moment and how I felt at the time. My appreciation for your thoughtful comments (and striatic's) is sincere.","Look at the larger pictures to get rid of the comments.","I'm not sure this is a photo of Lincoln.

Lincoln's actions were to create a civil war, to continue subjugation and theft of wealth.  He effected this by blatantly contravening the constitution, and by so doing set the precedence for the mess we have today.  His words and speeches are many, but I find his pre-presidency stage to be most revealing.  To anyone who thinks Lincoln was an advocate of freedom and equality, well pls read this quote....\n\n&quot;I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.&quot;       ― U.S. Senate candidate Abraham Lincoln, 1858.\n\nIsn't history interesting?","These are people that shouldn't be forgotten in the American History.","You can see the yrs wearing on him here from the previous picture.","Whoa...he looks so strange in this one!","Mr. Lincoln kind of looks like my uncle Gary in this photo...

The Lib of Congress is an amazing place!\n\nNOTE:  If you go to the LOC website, (listed) you can view a photo of the Lincoln/Johnson medailion, including the obverse.","<b>Hannibal Hamlin  &quot;Lincoln's Frustrated Vice President&quot;  August 27, 1809 - July 4, 1891 \n\nAbraham Lincoln's first vice president, Hannibal Hamlin, was a distinguished New England politician who served six terms in the Maine legislature (1836-40 and 1847); represented his state in the House of Representatives for two terms; and interrupted his second term in the U.S. Senate in 1857 to serve as governor of Maine, a position he soon resigned to re-enter the Senate. \n\nHamlin was a Democrat until 1856, when he broke with the party over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and joined the Republican party. When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination at the convention held at the Wigwam in Chicago on May 8, 1860, party leaders sought a vice-presidential candidate who would balance the ticket. Hannibal Hamlin seemed to be a good choice. A former Democrat with antislavery sentiments, he was geographically desirable since he came from a northeastern state. \n\nHamlin had not wanted the vice presidency. Having traded his influential Senate seat for a traditionally powerless office, he hoped to be assigned some important function in the Lincoln government. Although the president listened to his views, which included his urging the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation and the enlisting of free blacks in the army, Hamlin was relegated to the background. \n\nHamlin resented his idleness, but he did not want to be replaced as vice president. When the president and his advisors decided it would be politically expedient to name Andrew Johnson, military governor of Tennessee, to the vice-presidential spot in 1864, Hamlin was again disappointed. \n\nAfter his vice presidency, Hamlin was collector of customs for the port of Boston, served again in the Senate (1869-81), and concluded his public career by serving as minister to Spain (1881-82) during the Arthur administration. He died suddenly on July 4, 1891, at his club in Bangor. \n\nFascinating Fact:  Frustrated by his lack of meaningful work while vice president, Hamlin enlisted as a private in the Maine Coast Guard and invoked public criticism by taking his place among the ranks during the 1864 summer encampment at Kittery. </b>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://civilwar.bluegrass.net/PoliticsAndPoliticians/hannibalhamlin.html\">civilwar.bluegrass.net/PoliticsAndPoliticians/hannibalham...</a>","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/40994294@N00/\">Tintypes, ambrotypes, Wet-plate Collodion photographs</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","I actually own one of these.

It's the arched eyebrow.","Looks like they had a horrible tailor!","I like the raised eyebrow in this shot. I wonder what he was thinking.","As for the clothing---I think that Lincoln was not into being a fashionable Dandy and that he was probably a bit slovenly in his personal habits.  He probably didn't like to take the time for a tailor to fit him or it is possible that he bought clothes before moving to Washington, DC and lost a lot of weight while President.  The stresses on him were amazing, both nationally and personally, especially with the loss of his one son in the White House.\nHe appears to be wearing the same oversized frock coat in many of these photos.","Lincoln's face looks like it was heavily retouched - none of the blemishes that appear in other photos.","I am so thrilled to see all these great historical photos on Flickr.\nThank you !","mmeee tooo!~THank You!~","a commanding presence even in just a photo.","What a marvelous individual the man was, his presence can still be felt in just a photo.

(The Victorians didn't have the plastics used in modern &quot;film&quot;; the best they could do was clunky, fragile glass.)  So, the unknown archivist who wrote &quot;lincoln's funeral&quot; simply wrote it on the wrong side of the plate, so that it came out backward when printed.

The article mentions, &quot;After [the death of Mrs. Lawson], and with the marriage of all of their children, [Thomas W.] Lawson found the great place lonely.&quot;  He'd tried many hobbies such as bulldog breeding and given up on them, finally settling on trading in the stock market and breeding police dogs.\n\nI'm not clear on what exactly caused his economic hardships, but it has to do with a &quot;Haskell failure&quot;.\n\nSo enough about the people!  Let's hear about the dogs!\n\nDreamwold Irish Boy is the bulldog. Is Noswal Neto a Pekingese?\n\nPresumably D. Irish Boy was long retired at this point.\n\nNYTimes has Dreamwold Irish Boy winning several awards:\n\nFeb 20, 1913.  Westminster. Dreamwold Irish Boy wins &quot;Bulldogs. Open. Dogs (45 pounds and over)&quot;.  Mentions that Thomas W. Lawson had just spent $17,000 to bring four dogs from England with hopes of cleaning up the show, but it didn't work. D.

Lawson's Dreamwold Merry Boy had recently won the Bulldog Club of America.\n\nMay 24, 1914 - &quot;Irish Boy Best in Show&quot;; lists owner as Arnold Lawson; Nassau Kennel Club annual dog show, among 600 entries; also won best Bulldog, beating English prize dog.  Oddly, the same article later on says that Lawson's dog Dreamwold Centaur won a special prize available to members only.\n\nAlso, in 2002 the Scituate Historical Society published a book about Dreamwold: <a href=\"http://www.scituatehistoricalsociety.org/gift_home.html\">Beauty, Strength, Speed: Celebrating 100 Years of Thomas W. Lawson's Dreamwold</a>","Lucie Mitchell was formerly married to Herbert Barnum Seeley. according to NYT article from December 17, 1905:\nARNOLD LAWSON ENGAGED.; Eldest Son of Thomas W. to Marry the Former Mrs. Herbert Seeley.  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505E5DB153AE733A25754C1A9649D946497D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505E5DB153AE733A...</a>\n\nThe article notes that her former husband was last heard of as a ticket-seller at the Hippodrome!!","The March 1920 issue of Dogdom [see <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=aHcCAAAAYAAJ\">books.google.com/books?id=aHcCAAAAYAAJ</a> ] suggests that Noswal Neto was a Pekingese\n\nPage 47 has an ad:\nIMPORTED STUD and puppies—Noswal Neto, the sensational stud Pekingese.

Seeley, of the 'Seeley dinner' fame.&quot; The famed Seeley dinner was an 1896 private restaurant dinner busted by the police because of the nearly nude women dancers, especially the one called &quot;Little Egypt&quot;. Herbert Seeley was the dinner's host. He married Lucie in 1900, who seems to have divorced him 1903; a first article, that they were at court, gives his worth at $400,000; the article announcing the divorce says he spent his 1900 inheritance within a few years. That, from the previous incident, isn't hard to imagine. (I read about it, BTW, in Kenneth Whyte's <i>The Uncrowned King: The Sensational Rise of William Randolph Heart</i>, which is on my list of the best books that crossed my desk last year.)\n\n(And yes, Boston Ave. still is - in Toronto's east end, which would have been relatively undeveloped  or recently developed at the time.)","Last pieces for now! Though I'm intrigued by the dogs being important enough to name. Lucie was only 17 when she married Seeley, and 20 at that divorce. She was out of the picture by the time her father-in-law Thomas's fortune collapsed. Her husband sued her for divorce in 1920, naming one Leonard Lawrence as co-respondent; she claimed desertion. They had four children at the time. He's had detectives on her trail for months. \n\nJudging from the wardrobe but more so form their faces, and their posture, I'd judge this photo to be from the late 1910s. They seem to have no reason for such attention but his father's wealth and, I suppose, the dogs.","Thank you for this information!

He chose to fight under the name of the Constant-Marino, a tribute to the prestigious champion Namurois Constant-le-Boucher. Why marine? Because he had the ambition to &quot;beyond the seas and oceans&quot; the name of the school liégeoise control.

However,\nthere is not such a pathway with an uphill there. Today there is an owergrown path where I suppose there was a short railway from the quarry to the gate construction works downfalls. So short time afterwards also this bank would have been less overgrown. And there is also a small cliff in the river at Trangen, but it is not connected with the gates with this screen wall from upstream, what is the case here. And this screen comes from Vrangfoss. So this is \nthe downstram inlet to Vrangfoss gatelocks (Vrangfoss' underkanal med skjermen) at position UTM 32V 6573542N 512167 E. The pathway is also today used by many canal tourists for a short walk between Eidsfoss and Vrangfoss while the canal boat is being sluiced through. The pathway was later reconstructed and diverted from the original route from the top of the uphill on towards Vrangfoss in the late 1950ies and early 60'ies when hydroelectric stations were constructed in both waterfalls. The old tourist pathway turned right from the top of the hill and crossed Yttingen or Eiebekken brook on a wooden bridge (Børtebrua) that fell down in the 1970'ies but was later reconstructed. The local shop (Børtebua) at Vrangfoss was also situated on the other side of this brook, but must have been out of business since the late 1940'ies. On the other side of the pathway from the shop, close to the river was Kongens utsikt, from where the next picture \n in this series (with a view of the Vrangfoss locks) is taken.","I'm really liking the colorized look with all of these library of congress shots, good stuff","Eidsfoss all right, at the Bandakkanal (Norsjø-Bandakkanalen) -\nthe locks and waterfall between Ulefoss (3 km downstream) and\nVrangfoss (0,8 km upstream).

Those are political/administrative units created in 1919. \n\nBack then, most of what is today known as Telemark fylke, was <i>Brattsberg amt</i>, and Buskerud was first <i>Ringerike, Hallingdal, Eiker og Buskeruds amt</i>, and later just <i>Buskerud amt</i>. The name Telemark was used as for a geographical, not political, area. And Kongsberg is no doubt part of Telemark in that sense, just as Grenland is <u>not</u>.\n\nSince Telemark was chosen as the name of the county in 1919, the meaning of Telemark has since shifted towards including Grenland, and excluding Kongsberg.

The number of room in the boat tell the class of boat. The boat is very fast in the water to row and was also a fast sail boat. The most usual sail was square sail.

(Tvinde is apparently also a place name.) The resident hosts in 1910 were Johan W. Furubo, his wife Hildur, and their eight year-old daughter, Alma Marie.

The Nordfjord roundtrip includes the glaciers at Briksdal or Lodal (part of Jostedalen). They would go by cars with chauffeurs, and these trips would take a couple of days, before returning to Geiranger.

He should be able to see the king who is the only person above him in rank.","Trond: If possible, you should get into the Stortingspresident's office and take a present-day picture of this view and post it here.","The Royal Palace\n\nThe Danish-born architect Hans Ditlev Franciscus Linstow (1787-1851) was commissioned to design the new palace.\nThe Royal Palace was built as a residence for King Carl Johan (then king of Norway and Sweden), but was not completed until spring 1849, after his death. On 15 March 1849 the Lord Chamberlain took possession of the new palace on behalf of King Oscar I, and on 26 July it was formally inaugurated in the presence of the whole Royal Family.\n\nThe proposal to build a royal residence in Oslo was raised in the Storting (Norwegian national assembly) for the first time in 1821, but this was not followed up until the following year, when King Carl Johan himself proposed it to the Storting. In spite of the pressures on the Norwegian economy, the Storting allocated 150,000 rix-dollars for the work, and in 1823 a commission was appointed to oversee the sale of government bonds to finance the project and to have overall responsibility in matters concerning the building. By 1827 the palace foundations were completed. However, the allocated money had already been spent, and between 1827 and 1833 all building work ceased, since the Storting was not willing to grant further funds. The original plan was a building in the shape of an H, but this had to be revised for financial reasons, and it was decided to build a simple U shape. When King Carl Johan died in 1844, it was immediately apparent that the Palace would be too small for the new Royal Family. The Storting therefore granted an additional allocation for the purpose of beautifying the exterior and enlarging the wings. The original roof, which no one had considered to be satisfactory, was lowered, and a monumental temple front with pillars was added to the main façade.\n\nA variety of changes have been made to the Palace since it was first inhabited in 1849. At the end of the century the sanitation was improved and electricity was installed. Until King Haakon and Queen Maud arrived in Norway in 1905, the Palace had only been lived in for short periods at a time, during visits to Oslo by the Norwegian-Swedish King. It was therefore quite unsuitable as a permanent home for the new Royal Family. In order to meet their needs a set of Royal apartments was installed, with bathrooms and lavatories.\nMinor rehabilitation and maintenance work was undertaken during King Olav’s reign (1957-1991).\n\nThe Royal Palace is owned by the state and placed at the disposal of the head of state. When Harald V became king at the beginning of the 1990s, a survey of the building showed that it was in need of a complete renovation.\nThe state of the electrical system aroused concern, the kitchens and sanitation had seen very little improvement since 1906 and the working conditions for the staff did not comply with the national working environment regulations. The fire alarm system and fire walls were inadequate and the emergency exits were not secure. The façade had not been properly maintained and there was discovered rot in the floor beams. The layout of the rooms was functionally impractical. \n\nIn 1993 the Royal Court presented a general plan for the renovation of the Palace, and the Directorate of Public Construction and Property was given the task of restoring the building and upgrading the Royal Apartments. The rebuilding and rehabilitation was carried out in consultation with the Royal Family and representatives of the state, the Royal Court and the Directorate for Cultural Heritage. The work involved comprehensive and complicated changes.\n\nOn 15 March 1999, 150 years to the day after the Lord Chamberlain took possession of the original building, the Directorate of Public Construction and Property was able to deliver a completely restored and renovated building. The furnishing and decoration of the Royal Apartments was undertaken as a separate project in 1999 under the leadership of the Royal Court. The apartments were completed in spring 2001.\n\nFacts\nLaying of the foundation stone: 1 October 1825\nInauguration: 1849 \nThe base measures 3.593,3 m² \nLength of the main wing: 100,8 m\nWidth of the main wing: 24,1 m \nLength of the side wings: 40,7 m\nWidth of the side wings: 14,3 m\nHeight: 25 m\nTotal area: 17,624 m² \nNumber of rooms: 173\n\nThe University\n\nThe University of Oslo is Norway’s largest and oldest institution of higher education. It was founded in 1811 when Norway was still under Danish rule. As a satellite of the modest Danish kingdom until early in the 19th century, Norway was understandably not among the first places to found a university. The larger kingdoms of medieval Europe – Italy, France, England – established their first universities as early as the 12th century. The Scandinavian monarchies, Sweden and Denmark at the time, opened their first universities at Uppsala in 1477 and at Copenhagen in 1479, respectively. In 1811, the Danish monarch King Frederick VI granted Norway the right to found its own university. Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet (The Royal Frederick University) opened in Oslo in 1813. At the start, conditions were meagre; classes were held in rented buildings. The early modest period persisted for almost half a century, before the University had its own building complex. Although builders laid the cornerstone of the first building in 1841, the first lecture was not held at the new university until 1853. By 1856 construction work on three buildings was finally completed on Oslo’s main boulevard, Karl Johans gate (then Slotsveien). In 1923, university administrators and the Norwegian government agreed to develop a new campus just outside of the downtown area in a neighbourhood called Blindern. Because of an economic recession, however, the plans were shelved. Only in 1931 could the first institutes move to the new campus. In the 1960s the Greater Blindern area was developed. This area is today associated by most people as the centre of the University of Oslo. One of the four original faculties at the University of Oslo, The Faculty of Law, are still using the old buildings.\n\nGrand Hotel\n\nThe Grand Hotel first opened its doors in 1874. The Louis XVI revival style building, with its hint of Nordic art nouveau and characteristic clock tower from 1913, is right on Karl Johans gate, Oslo's main street. The hotel has been extended and modernized over the years, and today, the Grand Hotel has 290 rooms, including 52 suites, 15 conference rooms, and a number of restaurants and bars. \nThe Grand Hotel has been the talk of the town since the days of playwright Henrik Ibsen.","<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34428100@N04/3200591397/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3427/3200591397_90f1b938fc.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"[Carl Johans Gade with Slotted (i.e., Slottet?), Christiania, Norway] 2008\" /></a>\n\nWe at ABC Nyheter are trying to recreate the set in 2008. This photo was taken from the office of the Parliament leader Thorbjørn Jagland.","My father and his uncle were walking past the palace one day.  My father suggested lightheartedly that they stop by and say hello to the king.  My uncle replied that he and the king had an understanding.  He didn't bother the king while in Oslo, and the king didn't bother him while in Eidsvoll Verk.\n\nI am enjoying these photos immensely!","Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1220548@N21/\">Oslo – før og nå</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","Grand Hotel was modernized 1911-13.

A more accurate dating would be the summer of 1897. My conclusion is based on the following: \nThe City Hall which is the red brick building with its clock tower (behind the aft spar of the steamer) stood ready in December 1896 and was inaugurated on January 9, 1897. The former City Hall (built 1799) which is the two storeys high gray building to the right of the new City Hall was demolished before the end of 1897. As pedestrians and passengers on the steamer are lightly dressed and use sunshades it has to be late spring, summer or august at the latest.","This adds to the accumulating evidence that the pictures were taken during a Scandinavian trip in 1897: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3174199367\">S.A.

Colors on the photochroms can be deceiving, because they were applied by hand.  But the colorist definitely reckoned the flagon the square tower was blue (Swedish) and the flags on the ferry were red (Danish).  I was struck by the house flag flown on the tallest mast of the ferry.

It would be worth looking at period photos of Newark for comparison.  \n\nThe Buick in the foreground has a New York license plate, number 35227 from 1913, and has “Official Scout” tarped over the engine.  The vehicle on the right has plate 8515 which appears to say “NJ” in the top right and “13” below it: New Jersey Plates.  The car on the left, 1226, also has a blurry “NJ” with some sort of circular mark and then “13” below it.  The layout matches New Jersey’s porcelain plates from 1913, with red text and a metal seal where the circular mark is.\n\nInformation about this hike is in a number of New York Times and Washington Post articles starting January, 1913.  NYTimes Jan 13, 1913 p22 &quot;18-day March to Capital&quot; describes Jones' announcement of the hike in Philadelphia.  Wa Post Feb 13 1913 p1 “Cold Feet in Ranks” describes the zero-degree walk in New Jersey on day one, where the core 16 hikers were accompanied by 184 single dayers.  Wa Post Feb 18 1913 p1 “Army Escapes Rout” describes the marchers snowballed and stoned by young boys and laughed at by adults near Chester, Pennsylvania – finally they were escorted by cadets on horseback from the Chester Military College. NY Times Feb 24 1913 p11 “Col. Craft Defiant” describes stragglers' arrival in Baltimore.  Wa Post Feb 24 1913 p1 “Two Armies Now” describes fourteen of the original sixteen arriving in Baltimore.  Wa Post Feb 25 1913 p2 “Pilgrims Not Weary” arranging for Thursday reception at Washington, DC.  Wa Post Feb 27 1913 p1 “Race Barrier is Up” describes the hikers’ plans to disband if they are joined by a group of negro women planning to hike with them into Washington – also describes cold shoulder given to marchers who attempted to join them at Laurel, Md with a flag “Votes for negro women”. Wa Post Feb 28, 1913 p1 “Army at City Gates” describes route planned into Washington, and the harsh treatment into Bladensburg, Md – after being jeered the entire way, at College Park the men with them were forced to fight off angry college students in the heavy rain.\n\nI thought the &quot;Official Scout&quot; car might be the yellow “ammunition wagon” described in the Washington Post of Feb 13 as driven by Miss Elizabeth Freeman, the “official orator.”  But apparently it was really a wagon, as <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3102890456/\">captured in this other Bain photo</a>.  The driver of the car resembles Jessie Stubs, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2449482252/\">pictured here with General Jones</a>, but should be Mrs. Richard Schultz (info below).","I'm still looking for historic photos of Newark, but this could be taken on Broad Street, which runs from the former Hudson tube stop at Park Place Station (NY Times articles on the 12th and 13th indicate they boarded at Fulton Street, and began the hike in Newark after a ride on the tube; NY Times Feb 13 describes a speech at Military Park).  The group traveled on Frelinghuysen Avenue, Newark Avenue, and then back on Broad Street.  The streetcars in the background would be of the Public Service Railway, running south perhaps to Elizabeth, New Brunswick or Perth Amboy.  The hikers went to Elizabeth and then New Brunswick the first day, February 12, 1913.\n\nWe get conflicting names for the driver of the lead car.  From the NY Times February 12, 1913, page 8:\n\n&quot;The auto of Maj.
