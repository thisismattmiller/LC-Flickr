In 1932, Machine Gun Kelley robbed a bank in Tupelo. Out of fear of a robbery in Columbus, Capt Sam Kaye was asked to loan a German machine gun he had brought home after WWI to the bank. It was placed on the bank’s mezzanine pointing down aimed at the front entrance. The bank hired WWI veteran, John Perry, to stand guard with the gun. Later the gun was returned to Kaye but Perry remained as a bank guard armed with a shotgun. The structure continued to serve as the main office until 1972 when growth of banking operations forced its relocation to a larger facility. In 1981, as a gesture of community goodwill and to honor an exceptional employee, the Merchants and Farmers Bank gave the building to the City of Columbus through the Columbus Civic Arts Council to be used as a Visual Arts Museum. When the Museum was relocated to Mississippi University for Women, the City returned the ownership.\"","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/53061735518/#comment72157720285782738","comment_author":"swanq","comment_date":"1690160254","google_maps_url_expanded":"https://www.google.com/maps/@33.4945684,-88.4280924,3a,75y,80h,96.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sBaVTbPhUY6LCul3srLYJOw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=tts&shorturl=1","latitude_from_expanded":33.4945684,"longitude_from_expanded":-88.4280924,"location_state":"Mississippi","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"53061431014","title":"Farmer's State Bank, Austin Avenue, Georgetown, Texas (LOC)","description":"Margolies, John,, photographer.

Using Google Translate: \"Just three weeks after Alfred Krupp's death, on August 5, 1887, the Essen city council decided to erect a memorial to the deceased. It was created by the prominent sculptor Fritz Schaper on behalf of the city of Essen and was ceremoniously unveiled on July 14, 1889, the second anniversary of Alfred Krupp's death.\" \"Until the end of World War II, the memorial remained virtually undamaged in its place, although around 90 percent of the inner city was destroyed by bombs in the aerial warfare. But after the time of National Socialism, Krupp's reputation declined because the company was now viewed critically as the “armory of the German Reich” under Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler. After the surrender, the statue was initially used by American press photographers as a backdrop, but strangers soon pushed it into one of the bomb craters surrounding it. It is unclear who recovered the bronze figure and the stone base, brought it to the factory site and stored it there. It is known that the memorial was re-erected in a residential area in 1952, one year after Alfred's imprisoned great-grandson, Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, was released. The tensions between the city and the Krupp company gradually eased during the economic miracle, so that in the spring of 1961, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Krupp company, the memorial was again displayed at the Marktkirche. However, it was not exactly at the previous location in the axis of Kettwiger Strasse, but to the west of the church, slightly covered by a tree.\" \"After 61 years, in 2006, the Krupp memorial was moved to its original location.\" For a postcard showing the location as it would have been in 1923, see commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Marktkirche_Essen_um_1912... 360° view from 2016 showing location: goo.gl/maps/amkfyRQkkWU49fmH6","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/51089828424/#comment72157718896171760","comment_author":"swanq","comment_date":"1617497161","google_maps_url_expanded":"https://www.google.com/maps/@51.4570075,7.012498,3a,75y,21.33h,98.6t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPYuiqhVpxzRIxhbgY-_a20D4NKWflUsvFVcD5y!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPYuiqhVpxzRIxhbgY-_a20D4NKWflUsvFVcD5y%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya274.00122-ro0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352?shorturl=1","latitude_from_expanded":51.4570075,"longitude_from_expanded":7.012498,"location_country":"Germany"},{"photo_id":"51089754226","title":"French at Wilhelm I statue, Essen (LOC)","description":"Bain News Service,, publisher.

Keith Memorial Theatre was a vaudeville house in Boston’s theater district. It opened on October 29, 1928 with the film “Oh Kay” starring Colleen Moore. This beautiful house later became part of the RKO theater chain and the RKO Keith’s switched to a movies only format. Its name was later changed to the Savoy Theatre and was purchased by Sack Theatres. In 1978, the Savoy Theatre was sold by Sack to the Opera Company of Boston, and the theater became known as the Opera House, for which it was used until 1990. The theater was renovated, restored, and reopened in July 2004 by Clear Channel Entertainment, and is now a site for touring Broadway shows and other live entertainment, known as the Boston Opera House.\" Streetview 2018","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/40526736833/#comment72157679634406908","comment_author":"swanq","comment_date":"1553975989","google_maps_url_expanded":"https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3539254,-71.0621443,3a,75y,301.8h,129.45t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZeicPUUFxfDO15lndUyPWg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?shorturl=1","latitude_from_expanded":42.3539254,"longitude_from_expanded":-71.0621443,"location_state":"Massachusetts","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"32550650837","title":"Darien Playhouse, Post Road, Darien, Connecticut (LOC)","description":"Margolies, John,, photographer.

Main St., 5FN.2284, Dr. Morgan Office, ca. 1927 (Photograph 37) This plain, one-story brown brick building with flat roof has some characteristics of the Mediterranean Revival style. The front façade (south side) has a central entrance with brick arch and inset wood door with three stepped lights. Flanking the entrance are flat arch plate-glass windows with brick sills. There is a center flat parapet above the entrance and projecting piers at each end of the wall. Between the piers and the parapet are slanting bands of metal tile. At the top and bottom of the wall are contrasting courses of red brick. Alterations. A 1981 survey photo shows the same door but the window openings have glass block; neither are believed to be original. The date the original windows and door were removed is unknown. Historic Background. A previous building on this site was removed by 1926, when Sanborn maps show the parcel to be vacant. The current building is shown on a 1949 map. In 1955, Dr. A.W. Morgan, an osteopath and surgeon, had his office here and in 1957, Bramer & Tull Optometrists were located here. In 1964, the Florence Chamber of Commerce had offices here, and Anthony Scutti was the secretary and manager for the organization.

A number of the mature trees on site were planted when the building was dedicated in 1929. The majority of the landscaping is contained within a semi-formal garden that frames a series of terraced lawn areas approaching the west façade where a public stage provides an outdoor performance venue. The landscape architect designed this series of terraced lawns to provide for public presentations, gatherings, community functions, debates and civic interaction. Among the plantings are 57 varieties of palms, Coast Redwoods (Sequoia Sempervirens), Saucer Magnolia (Magnolia X Soulangiana), and Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron Giganteum). The general design and layout of the courthouse follow a modified Spanish castle plan. The building is placed on the site so the most important rooms face south for natural heat gain to warm these spaces. There are many castle defensive elements used on the Santa Barbara County Courthouse. The architect used these Andalusian-Spanish castle elements as metaphorical connections to the Spanish roots of Santa Barbara and many of the design details are also metaphoric of castle defense elements. The courthouse is the seat of government for Santa Barbara County, much like a castle is the seat of its ruler. The courthouse complex is comprised of four buildings connected by either a bridge or arch, taking an overall form much like a capital \"L.\" Because these buildings were constructed at the same time and are interconnected by arches and bridges, they are considered one building for the purpose of the National Historic Landmark designation. The main façade of the building that faces Anacapa Street (south) stretches across the site some 370 feet. The Figueroa Street façade (east) is 356 feet and the Santa Barbara Street façade (north) is 161 feet. The building height varies from 40 feet up to 111 feet. The site changes in elevation by as much as four feet, dropping to the East. The sunken gardens drop below the level of the main arch entry paving by six feet. The general \"L\" shape of the building protects the garden (also called a \"bailey,\" in castle terms). The clock tower observation deck (El Mirador or \"keep,\" in castle terms) rises 88 feet above the ground entry level. This height provides the best defensive vantage point across the garden, the main entrance, and outer points in the approach of the courthouse. The Rotunda, located at the intersection of the Anacapa and Figueroa wings, provides access to the alarm bell located at the outside southeast corner of the building. The northeast corner of the courthouse is defended by means of a turret with lancets, machicolations and embrasures. Architect: William Moser and William Moser, Jr. Architectural Style: Spanish Colonial Revival Property Type: Courthouse Original Use: courthouse \"","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/31561809187/#comment72157703742978281","comment_author":"swanq","comment_date":"1546298212","google_maps_url_expanded":"https://www.google.com/maps/@34.424086,-119.7028156,3a,75y,45.56h,102.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sikzZt-nOzc9sEvoQ7cgXDQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?shorturl=1","latitude_from_expanded":34.424086,"longitude_from_expanded":-119.7028156,"location_state":"California","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"32628815098","title":"Old City Hall, angle 1, 7th & Orange Streets, Riverside, California (LOC)","description":"Margolies, John,, photographer.

THE HOTEL WAS CONSTRUCTED IN A U SHAPE, WITH THE ENTRANCE ARCADE FORMING THE FORTH SIDE OF THE RECTANGLE - Anaconda Historic District, Marcus Daly Hotel, 200-208 Main Street, Anaconda, Deer Lodge County, MT \" History is at www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/mt0111/ \"The construction of the Montana Hotel (renamed The Marcus Daly Hotel) was begun in 1888 by the Montana Hotel Association. It was completed in the spring of 1889 at an estimated cost of $125,000. Designed by Chicago Architect W.W. Boyington, this building was heavily financed by Marcus Daly, mining magnate and patron of the Smelter City. Using a composite style of French Renaissance and Romanesque architecture, the hotel was a 120 feet square, four story structure built of local red brick with terra cotta ornamentation. The building sits 10 feet back from the Main Street sidewalk and features a 34 foot wide central arched entrance resting on terra cotta columns with a pediment above. The hotel interior included a full basement equipped with a servant's dining room, a laundry, boilers, and a dynamo for electric light generation. The first and second floors, finished in red oak and eastern pine, contained the main dining room, a ladies' ordinary, billiard hall, drug store, and barber shop. After Marcus Daly died in 1900, the Montana Hotel underwent extensive remodeling, costing $96,000 under the ownership of the Anaconda Company. In 1954, the building was purchased by Edison and Bell, Inc. of Kalispell, MT. The firm operated the hotel until 1959 at which time plans for demolition were considered. To combat this action, citizens of Anaconda formed the Montana Hotel Corporation and purchased the structure, renaming it the Marcus Daly Hotel. A restoration project was undertaken in 1964 and a modern motel unit was built to the rear of the original structure. In 1975, heavy financial burdens and potential bankruptcy faced the Montana Hotel Corporation and the building was sold to a local developer in 1976. An aggressive program of structural renovation was begun, including the removal of the hotel's two upper stories. The remaining space will be used for retail and office space.\"","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/45187498464/#comment72157675906889198","comment_author":"swanq","comment_date":"1542804593","google_maps_url_expanded":"https://www.google.com/maps/@46.1289487,-112.9531329,3a,75y,302.15h,92.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLrUxhLAtS0zpBthheIGy1Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?shorturl=1","latitude_from_expanded":46.1289487,"longitude_from_expanded":-112.9531329,"location_state":"Montana","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"45187478074","title":"Old hotel by the tracks, Gulpwater, Wyoming (LOC)","description":"Margolies, John,, photographer.

After building this property and practicing for a few years, he left Beatrice in 1886 to return to Nebraska City where he remained a gentleman farmer supplementing his income with a sizable inheritance. It has display windows on either side of a recessed entry and a glass transom above as part of its storefront. Two identifiable window fenestrations are blocked over with stucco on the second story and a decorative gabled cornice with brackets and finials finishes the façade. The building name is integrated under the gabled cornice between the two center brackets. The building was constructed in 1886. An original bay window was removed in the early 1980s after structural failure. Everett Druggists and Sundries was the main commercial occupant of this building during its renovation in the 1960s.\" www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/16000481.pdf","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/43815747834/#comment72157695311255750","comment_author":"B-59","comment_date":"1536513232","location_state":"Nebraska","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"42724620670","title":"Commercial building, Main Street, Gordon, Nebraska (LOC)","description":"Margolies, John,, photographer.

The Owen-Maclure community used the space for a variety of purposes from a multi-family dwelling, to a warehouse, to a venue for hosting lectures and dances. In 1859, the structure was purchased by the New Harmony Dramatic Association and renamed Union Hall. The building was transformed into a theater and was home to a famous local acting company, the Golden Troupe. In 1888, Eugene Thrall became the sole owner and the theater was renamed Thrall’s Opera House. For a short time from 1911 to 1913, the Opera House was a nickelodeon movie house until it was purchased in 1914 and turned into a gas station and garage. In 1964, the space was purchased by the Harmonie Associates, who persuaded the state of Indiana to purchase, restore, and maintain the site.\" visitnewharmony.com/playexplore_cpt/thralls-opera-house/ \" When the opera house was first constructed in 1824, it wasn't an opera house at all. It was a communal building created by the Harmonists, the religious group that founded New Harmony, to house single people that wanted to come and live in the Harmonist utopia. The building was the fourth such communal building, and the last building that the Harmonists built in New Harmony before selling the town and moving out to Pennsylvania. Over the next few decades, the building housed a number of different businesses, including a Sunday school, a store, and a warehouse. In 1859 it was purchased by the New Harmony Dramatic Association for use as a theater and dance hall. Various theatrical groups, like New Harmony's famous Golden Troupe, used the theater to stage their productions. Eugene S. Thrall, a man who had been co-owner of the building since 1867, bought out the rest of it in 1888 and remolded the front, adding the opera house styled facade you see today. He also changed the name of the building to Thrall's Opera House. It was used as an opera house until 1910, after which it was used the next few decades as a nickelodeon movie house and a Conoco gas station. In 1964 the Indiana Department of Natural Resources bought the building, thanks to the efforts of the Harmonie Associates, renovated it to be used as a theater once again. Thrall's Opera House still hosts various musical productions on its stage, as well as workshops, lectures, and balls. Visitors can go to the opera house and marvel at the style of its auditorium room, which harkens back to late 19th-century America.\" www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=23565","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/42345714761/#comment72157695527398241","comment_author":"artolog","comment_date":"1527265494","location_state":"Indiana","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"42297454882","title":"Fairmont Opera House, angle 1, Downtown Plaza, Fairmont, Nebraska (LOC)","description":"Margolies, John,, photographer.

John J. Pershing led a victory parade down New York City’s Fifth Avenue. Vast crowds cheered as 25,000 U.S. soldiers who had served in the American Expeditionary Force’s 1st Division on the Western Front marched from 107th Street to Washington Square in Greenwich Village, wearing trench helmets and full combat gear.'New York lived yesterday probably the last chapter in its history of great military spectacles growing out of the war,' The New York Times reported. The loudest cheers were for Pershing, who, according to the Times, 'was kept at almost continual salute by the tributes volleyed at him from both sides of the avenue.'\"By the time an armistice was declared on Nov. 11, 1918, more than 2 million American soldiers had served on the battlefields of Western Europe. Roughly 50,000 of them were killed in action. \"In September 1919, Congress authorized President Woodrow Wilson to promote Pershing, the commander of the expeditionary force, to the rank of General of the Armies of the United States. He remains the sole person to be promoted in his own lifetime to the highest rank in the U.S. Army. \"Congress also authorized Pershing to create his own insignia. He chose to wear four gold stars for the rest of his career, which meant he outranked subsequent Army chiefs of staff, who wore four silver stars, and even the five-star General of the Army insignias worn during World War II by George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower. \"Pershing led a similar victory parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington on Sept. 17. On Sept. 19, he addressed a joint session of the Congress. He died in 1948 at age 87.\" Sources: The New York Times; History.com – Andrew Glass, Politico Street view (2016) 5th Avenue at West 14th St","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/34425491206/#comment72157680249163884","comment_author":"Pixel Wrangler","comment_date":"1494011104","google_maps_url_expanded":"https://www.google.com/maps/@40.735916,-73.9937339,3a,75y,23.93h,86.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHjOetPXdr4FGsWqo82Zybw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en&shorturl=1","latitude_from_expanded":40.735916,"longitude_from_expanded":-73.9937339,"location_state":"New York","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"33801038420","title":"Altwied Castle, Germany (LOC)","description":"Bain News Service,, publisher.

To the left are 3 bays of cross casements fitted with plate-glass horned sashes. The first-floor windows have 2 transoms. Small pediments in the balustraded parapet. These bays have paired pilasters right and left. The centre bay has one 3-light cross casement (with sashes) to each of its 3 floors. The right-hand 3 bays contain the round-arched principal entrance and two 2-light cross casements as before. Paired pilasters separate the first-floor cross casements which have the double transoms and now round heads. Swags in the parapet. A tower, square on plan, rises through 2 storeys to an ogeed lantern: open round arches over clock faces; glazed lantern. The south-west facade faces the river: symmetrical; 8 bays plus closing bays right and left. Cross casements fitted with sashes as before. Garlanded parapet and central segmental pediment. Hipped roofs with flat. INTERIOR: the entrance hall has pairs of panelled baluster piers on high plinths alternating with single piers running down the centre and attached as pilasters to the walls. Modified Ionic capitals. An Imperial staircase rises to the east: open string, twisted balusters over vases, moulded handrail. Pairs of painted glass windows light the stairs from a small internal courtyard. The whole of the west side of the first floor is given over to a ceremonial hall of 9 by 3 bays, the bays divided by fluted pilasters. The north wall has paired fluted columns and pilasters, the south wall has Corinthian columns set in front of pilasters. Heavy modillion cornice with leaf-trail decoration and deep coving below a barrel-vaulted roof with eared and shouldered raised panels. The south-east corner of the first floor was used until 1990 as a magistrates court with a complete set of fittings from 1882. Panelled bench and dock, the latter with an internal staircase dropping to a secure room and side entrance on the ground floor. The council chamber has a canopy at the west end and a gallery at the east end. \" list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1246969 Full restoration in 2008: archiseek.com/2009/1878-municipal-buildings-great-yarmout... 2012 Google Street View: www.google.com/maps/@52.606173,1.724362,3a,75y,118.9h,100...","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/16595494987/#comment72157649006862633","comment_author":"artolog","comment_date":"1426264287","location_country":"United Kingdom"},{"photo_id":"16801686582","title":"[St. Peter's Church, Yarmouth, England] (LOC)","description":"[St. Peter's Church, Yarmouth, England] [between ca. 1890 and ca. 1900]. 1 photomechanical print : photochrom, color.

The claim that this is the location of his death appears to date from no earlier than a 17th-century visit by Charles II to the forest. At the time the most popular account of William's death involved the fatal arrow deflecting off a tree, and Charles II appears to have been shown a suitable tree. Letters in The Gentleman's Magazine reported that the tree was cut down and burned during the 18th century. Later in that century the Rufus stone was set up. Originally it was around 5 feet 10 inches tall (1.78 m) with a stone ball on top. King George III visited the stone in 1789, along with his queen, and an inscription was added to the stone to commemorate the visit. It was protected with a cast iron cover in 1841 after repeated vandalism. The inscription on the Rufus Stone reads: Here stood the oak tree, on which an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell at a stag, glanced and struck King William the Second, surnamed Rufus, on the breast, of which he instantly died, on the second day of August, anno 1100. King William the Second, surnamed Rufus, being slain, as before related, was laid in a cart, belonging to one Purkis and drawn from hence, to Winchester, and buried in the Cathedral Church, of that city.\" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_England#The_Rufus_Stone Google Street View, 2011: www.google.com/maps/@50.911403,-1.616883,3a,75y,215.68h,7...","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/16776906266/#comment72157650917458460","comment_author":"artolog","comment_date":"1426259999","location_country":"United Kingdom"},{"photo_id":"16736250165","title":"Jaffa gate (LOC)","description":"Bain News Service,, publisher.

How do I know this? In the plate glass window in the center of the picture, I've noted the name \"Collinwood Hotel Restaurant\". It can be seen in the center of the inset in this detail of the 1903 Sanborn fire insurance map for the area: The shape of the building in the photo corresponds exactly to the shape of the Hotel Collinwood building on the Sanborn map. The street numbers do not correspond due to a change in the numbering system for the streets that occurred in 1905. Further evidence of the location is provided by this plate from the 1921 Plat Book of the City of Cleveland. It shows the correct profile for the building, and gives the address as 630 - the number shown on the building in the photo. A streetcar is visible, slightly out of focus, at the right edge of the photograph. This corresponds to the streetcar tracks shown on the map in the Plat Book.","comment_permalink":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4546012642/#comment72157624516384634","comment_author":"Christopher Busta-Peck","comment_date":"1279309276","location_state":"Ohio","location_country":"USA"},{"photo_id":"4465096574","title":"Madison Ave. Methodist Church  (LOC)","description":"Bain News Service,, publisher.

Another bit of evidence: the street address for the firehouse is 87-91 Lafayette Street, while the signage on the corner building shows the number \"84\" (backwards), which is presumably part of its street address. Additionally, according to Google Maps, the tall building in the middle with the arched windows at the top is still standing--it's at Lafayette and Walker, a block away.
